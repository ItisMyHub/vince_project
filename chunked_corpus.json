I love my family and feel really guilty because I don't want to hurt them. But I'm afraid I can't be what they want me to be.\n\nHelp! What should I do?\n\n## Answer\n\nI think you should start by telling an adult you trust about your situation. This could be a teacher, school counsellor, or someone at a youth guidance centre.\n\nTalk to a friend first if that feels easier. That might give you the confidence you need to talk to an adult.\n\nYou can also contact RFSL stödmottagning. They have experience in supporting people who are at risk because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. You can be anonymous when you call or email them.\n\nYou write that you feel guilty and do not want to hurt your family. It is not good to be alone with those feelings.

My family or someone my family knows might check for blood. I don’t know what to do. My friend told me that I can have an operation to get my virginity back, how do I do that?\n\n## Answer\n\nYou are not alone. Your question is quite common. For the answer to your question to make sense, you need to know a few things about the vagina.\n\n### Facts about the vagina and how it works\n\nThe vagina has an opening that is present from birth. This means that there is no membrane covering or blocking the opening of the vagina. The tissue that is sometimes called a “hymen” is a myth – it doesn’t exist.\n\nThe vaginal opening looks different for everyone. It doesn’t change from having sex. No one can tell if you’ve had sex by looking at your body. Not even a doctor or midwife (a nurse specially trained in the female reproductive system).\n\nThe vagina is elastic. That’s why most people don’t bleed the first time they have sex. If you bleed, it may be because you are nervous or not aroused enough. You can also bleed even if you have had sex before.\n\n### What is hymenoplasty?\n\nHymenoplasty (hymen repair) means an operation where a doctor sews a few stitches at the edge of the vaginal opening so that it will bleed during sex. But you need to know the following:\n\n### What can you do?\n\nI don’t think you should have an ",

You also have the right to change your mind at any time before the abortion.\n\n## When can I have an abortion?\n\nA pregnancy is counted from the first day of your last period.

You are put under general anaesthesia during this abortion.\n\n## The cost of an abortion can vary\n\nThe cost of an abortion can vary depending on the part of the country. In many places, you do not need to pay anything if you are under 18 years of age.\n\n## Do my parents/guardians need to know?\n\nThe staff at the abortion clinic have taken an oath of confidentiality and cannot tell anyone about your appointments.

Every month, an egg cell matures into an egg. This process begins when you enter puberty and continues until you reach menopause. Eggs are formed in the ovaries.\n\nIt takes about two weeks for an egg to mature. While this is happening, the womb is preparing itself to be able to receive a fertilized egg.\n\nWhen an egg has matured, it loosens from the ovary and goes to the Fallopian tube.\n\nThe week before their period some women get what is called PMS. You might feel sad or angry. You might also feel energetic or want to eat sweets. Some women get more pimples. Your breasts might also feel tender.\n\nIf the egg isn’t fertilized by sperm, blood will leave the womb and come out through the vagina. This is what is called a menstrual period.\n\nIt is common to have cramps in your stomach or back before your period starts. Some women have a lot of pain, but menstrual cramps are not dangerous.  \n\nWhen your period is over, everything starts over again from the beginning, and a new egg matures in the ovaries.",

Penises can have different colours, lengths, thicknesses and can have different amounts of hair growing on them. It is common to have different spots and marks on the penis and scrotum.\n\nNobody can tell by looking at your penis or scrotum if you have had sex.\n\n## Different parts of the penis and scrotum\n\nThe pictures show where different parts of the penis and scrotum are located (in Swedish).\n\n## Sometimes a penis can become hard\n\nMost often, the penis is soft. It can swell and become hard, for example, when you are aroused. You get an erection. This is because the penis is filled with blood.\n\nIt is common for the penis to be a little crooked when you have an erection.\n\n## The skin on the penis and scrotum is thin\n\nThere is no fat under the skin of the penis and scrotum. For this reason, blood vessels, natural spots and the pores where strands of hair come from can be easily seen. The skin on the penis and scrotum usually turns a littler darker during puberty.\n\n## The head of the penis - the glans\n\nIn puberty, many people get small spots that stick out around the bottom edge of the glans. This is nothing dangerous, it is normal and exactly how it should be.\n\nThe tiny opening on the head of the penis is for urine and semen.

The tube inside the penis leads to both the bladder and the scrotum.\n\n## The foreskin\n\nThe outermost part of the penis is protected by a thin layer of skin that can be pulled down. This is called the foreskin. A kind of fluid is produced on the inside of the foreskin. This fluid keeps the head of the penis moist and protects it from bacteria.\n\nDifferent people have different amounts of foreskin. Many people have no foreskin at all because they have been circumcised. That means that all or parts of the foreskin have been surgically removed. Circumcision is performed for religious or traditional reasons, or because of a medical problem such as the foreskin being too tight.\n\n## A string of skin\n\nUnderneath the penis is a string of skin. This string of skin is tight. It can sometimes be a little too short, in which case there might occasionally be some bleeding when you have an erection. This can hurt a bit, but usually heals by itself.\n\n## The scrotum\n\nThe scrotum is the sack under the penis. It looks a little nubbyand has hair growing on it once you have reached puberty. There are two balls inside the scrotum, these are called the testicles. It is common for these to be of different sizes.\n\nSperm is created in the balls, inside the scrotum. Sperm collects in a thin, long tube behind the testicles.

An ejaculation usually contains about a teaspoon of fluid.\n\nThere are many millions of tiny sperm in the semen. They can fertilize an egg, which can lead to a pregnancy. The sperm however, is only a minor part of the semen. Most of it is fluid.\n\nNew sperm are created every day. This means that you can ejaculate as many times as you want without running out of sperm.\n\n## The anus\n\nThe anus is at the end of the rectum. This is where faeces come out.\n\n## Penises can be of different sizes\n\nThe penis and scrotum stop growing when puberty is over, roughly when you are between 18 and 20 years of age.

There are a lot of things I'm not allowed to do. I wasn't allowed to go on the school trip, and I'm not allowed to meet up with friends. If they suspect I haven't gone straight home from school, they get really angry and threaten me.\n\nI don't want to disappoint my family. I'm afraid of what would happen if I broke their rules.

What should I do?\n\n## Answer\n\nI understand that it feels lonely and unfair that you are not allowed to do things that other people get to do. Many young people in Sweden have similar problems. It may be because the family is worried about what other people think of them. The family may be afraid of getting a bad reputation and losing their honour. It is not okay that they threaten you, and help is available.\n\nYou write that your family will be very angry and threaten you if they suspect that you have not gone straight home from school.

I saw a TV programme about how smoking damages cells in your body, among other things. How dangerous is smoking if you are young and healthy and exercise?\n\n## Answer\n\nSmoking affects every part of your body and increases the risk of contracting many different diseases. Young people are affected more by smoking than adults regardless of whether they exercise or not. This is because your body is still growing and your brain has not finished developing.\n\nTobacco smoke contains a chemical called carbon monoxide, which replaces oxygen in the cells of your body. This means that smokers have less oxygen in their blood. Smoking makes you less fit and stops you developing in the same way as a non-smoker when you exercise.\n\nThe earlier you start smoking, the greater the risk of you becoming addicted. Cigarettes contain 4,000 different chemicals. Many of these chemicals are bad for the cells in your body. Exercising is good for your health, but not smoking is an even better way of reducing the risk of developing serious diseases.\n\n### Questions and answers\n\nHere you can read the queries sent in by young people to Ask UMO.

Only you can say what love is for you.\n\nThere are a huge number of films, song lyrics, books and diaries about love. People want to talk about the experience of love, as they see it.\n\n## It can be felt in different ways\n\nBeing in love can feel differently, at different times. When you´ve been in love for a while, it usually feels different from how it felt in the beginning.\n\nIt can feel exciting and tingly. You might feel full of energy, brave, happy or calm. You might fantasise a lot about the person you’re in love with. You might find it hard to think about anything else. Sometimes, being in love can make you feel nervous, unhappy or jealous. Some people find it difficult to eat or sleep when they’re in love.\n\nIt usually feels good to be close to the person you’re in love with. It can then feel like your heart is beating extra hard and extra fast. You might feel nervous, happy, shy or aroused.\n\n## Love might surprise you\n\nYou might fall in love with a person you know, or perhaps with someone you don’t know. The feeling can be really strong, even if you never meet that person or end up together. You might be in love with several people at the same time.\n\nLove might surprise you, for example if you fall in love with someone who’s a different gender to those you have fallen in love with previously.

Choose one that suits you. Don’t do anything that feels strange or wrong to you.\n\nMost people are happy when they find out that someone likes them.

Equality means that both men and women make decisions about their own bodies and their sexuality.\n\nEquality means greater freedom for everyone. Everyone should have the potential to be themselves and to feel safe.\n\nEquality is discussed in most countries and many countries are in the process of becoming more equal. However, no country has complete equality yet.\n\n## Equality is for both men and women\n\nMost often, it's girls who lose out when there is a lack of equality. Men have more power and money in the world. But boys lose out in other ways.\n\n## There are political objectives for equality\n\nIn Sweden, parliament has said that equality is important.

Discrimination is illegal.\n\n## A few examples that show that society isn’t equal\n\nThese examples are supported by statistics. They apply to women as a group and men as a group.

For example, what you should like, what emotions you should show or what kind of job you should have. These become like invisible rules for how girls and boys should be. Sometimes it may feel OK for it to be this way. But sometimes it can be very troubling or wrong.\n\nWhat is considered \"masculine\" and \"feminine\" can vary in different parts of the world. And it can change over time.\n\n## What do you think?\n\nThink about what this is like in your life. And consider how you think about men and women.

You can go to a Youth Guidance Centre (ungdomsmottagning), a gynaecological clinic or a health clinic (vårdcentral). You can talk to the school nurse if you are at school.\n\nThere are two special clinics for women who have been subject to female genital mutilation: the AMEL clinic (AMEL-mottagningen) in Stockholm and Vulvamottagningen at Angered Hospital in Gothenburg.

The surgical procedure can remove painful scars, or it can dilate the genital area to make it easier for you to urinate and for menstrual blood to leave your body. The surgical procedure will also help if you currently find it difficult to have sex or enjoy sex.

Most people get their first period sometime between the ages of 11 and 14. You could start getting your period when you are 9 or 16 without anything being wrong. Contact the school nurse, a youth guidance centre or a healthcare centre if you haven't started your period by the time you are 16 years of age.\n\n## How often and how much will I bleed?\n\nYour period usually comes once a month. But it is common for the time between periods to be shorter or longer, especially during the first year.\n\nMost people have their period for three to six days and bleed about 50 millilitres of blood. But it's different from person to person.\n\nThe colour of the period tends to be red for the first few days and brown for the last few days.\n\n## Menstrual cramps\n\nIt is common to have stomach pain during the first few days of your period. Some people have pain in their back, thighs or head.\n\nHere are some things you can try to relieve the pain:\n\n## Feeling bad before your period\n\nIt is common to feel sad or irritated in the days before your period starts.

I’ve heard that I can have surgery. Must my parents know if I have this surgery? Girl, 17 years of age.\n\n## Answers\n\nGood help is available to you. You can go to a Youth Guidance Centre (ungdomsmottagning), a gynaecological clinic or a health clinic (vårdcentral). You can talk to the school nurse if you are at school.\n\nThere are two special clinics for women who have been subject to female genital mutilation: the AMEL clinic (AMEL-mottagningen) in Stockholm and Vulvamottagningen at Angered Hospital in Gothenburg. You are welcome to visit these clinics no matter where you live in Sweden. You can get help with both physical and emotional problems.\n\nYou are in your right to have a surgery if you wish and if it is necessary. The surgical procedure can remove painful scars, or it can dilate the genital area to make it easier for you to urinate and for menstrual blood to leave your body. The surgical procedure will also help if you currently find it difficult to have sex or enjoy sex. You will be given more information when you seek help.\n\nYou do not need to talk to your parents if you do not want to. You can get help and have a surgery without their knowledge.\n\nYou can always ask for an interpreter if you need one.\n\n### Slide show: Circumcision of the vulva – female genital mutilation\n\nCircumcision of the vulva (th",

It varies from person to person when puberty begins. It is not something that you can influence or have control over.\n\nPuberty is set in motion by hormones. Hormones are chemical messengers that are produced by the body. The body’s hormones influence how your body functions in a variety of different ways. For example, through controlling your sleep, your blood pressure and your moods.\n\nKnowing that you are coming into puberty can lead to different emotions. Some people can not wait for puberty and think it is fun and exciting. Other people might think that it feels confusing or difficult.\n\nPuberty generally begins at some point between the ages of 8-13 years. Puberty as a process usually takes between five to six years.\n\nOnce puberty is over, you will have a more adult body and appearance. You will also have finished growing and will not get any taller.\n\nDuring puberty, you may get oilier skin. It is common to get blackheads and pimples.\n\nYour thoughts and feelings will change.\n\nYour mood might change more quickly than it did before. You might also become irritated about things that never irritated you before.\n\nYou might sometimes feel sad, or begin thinking about things in more depth.\n\nYou might become more interested in sex.

Perhaps you think about sex on a regular basis and become aroused when you do so.\n\nYou will get more hair on your body, for example under your arms. During puberty, you may also notice that you begin to sweat more.\n\nYour breasts will grow. This usually begins with a firmness behind the nipples. The nipples may become tender.\n\nIt is common for one breast to grow faster than the other.\n\nYou become taller. The body will change shape, especially around the hips and abdomen.\n\nWhen your body grows fast, you can get stretch marks across your skin, as your skin tries to keep up with your growth. These stretch marks can look like stretch lines or stripes. They usually fade over time. \n\nYou will get pubic hair.\n\nThe clitoris and labia will grow and change both colour and shape.\n\nYou might begin to see spots and bumps in this region, for example on the labia.\n\nYou will begin to get vaginal discharge. This is a fluid which comes from the vagina. Vaginal discharge is usually a white or an off yellow colour. Vaginal discharge keeps the vagina moist and free from bacteria.\n\nThe vaginal area may begin to smell differently during puberty. This is because of sweat and discharge.\n\nYou will begin to get your period. This is blood which comes from the vagina once a month.\n\nIt is common for periods to be irregular in the beginning.

Becoming pregnant can happen if you for example, have sexual intercourse and sperm enters the vagina. \n\nTalk to someone if you have any questions, or if puberty in any way feels difficult to deal with. For instance, you can talk to the school nurse, the school counsellor, or someone at a Youth Guidance Centre (ungdomsmottagning).\n\nContact the school nurse, a Youth Guidance Centre or a health clinic (vårdcentral) if you do not notice the signs of puberty setting in by the age of 14.

Now I compare myself to him all the time. I really don’t want to be reminded of her life before she met me, because it makes me feel really jealous. What should I do?\n\n## Answer\n\nYou can’t change the fact that your girlfriend has been in relationships before you got together. You can, however, work on accepting this fact.\n\nIt’s easy to forget that you may also have your own memories of previous relationships. Is this the case for you?\n\nIt’s common to compare yourself with your partner’s ex. But, try to think about your own positive qualities. And try to remember that her ex-boyfriend is not a threat. You’re an entirely different guy. You’ve chosen each other, and you are the one she’s with. So enjoy that fact!\n\nYou can tell your girlfriend that seeing the photos was tough. But also tell her that it’s OK. We should all be allowed to keep our old photos.\n\nJealousy is something that most people feel at some point in time. But, being extremely jealous can be hard work - both for you and for the person you’re with.\n\nSometimes, jealousy can come from low self-esteem or thinking that you’re not good enough, as you are.\n\nYou can try to boost your self-esteem and think about liking yourself, just as you are. That will no doubt make you feel less jealous.",

On one side is an adhesive strip that holds the pad in place. There are different sizes. Most girls need to change pads more often during the first days of their period. A pad may begin to smell or leak if you wear it too long.\n\n## Panty liner\n\nA panty liner is like a sanitary pad but smaller. You can use it at the end of your period when there is only a little blood. Some girls wear a panty liner when they use a tampon to avoid getting blood in their underpants if the tampon becomes full. \n\n## Tampon\n\nYou insert a tampon into the vagina. It absorbs blood so that it doesn’t leak. You can go swimming and do sports with a tampon.\n\nThere are different sizes of tampon. Choose a larger tampon if you bleed a lot. You can use a tampon even if you have never had sexual intercourse.\n\n### How to insert a tampon\n\nThe first time you try a tampon, do so when you are bleeding heavily since it is easier to insert. Choose a small tampon. It can be easier if you squat a little with your legs spread apart.\n\n### How often should I change tampons?\n\nChange the tampon when you think that it may be full of blood. It slides out easily when you pull the string.

Change the tampon when you are finished.\n\n### Can a tampon get stuck?\n\nBeing unable to remove a tampon is very uncommon. Squat and insert a finger. Grab the string or the tampon and pull. You can get help from a midwife at a youth guidance centre (ungdomsmottagning) if you cannot remove a tampon.\n\n## Menstrual cup\n\nA menstrual cup is made of soft rubber and can last for many years.\n\nYou insert it into the vagina and the blood flows into the cup.

It can be easier if you squat a little with your legs spread apart.\n\nYou should be able to feel the stem with your finger, but it should not stick out.\n\n### Removing, emptying and storing the menstrual cup\n\nTo remove it, pull the stem. You can empty the blood into the toilet.\n\nIt is usually enough to empty the sanitary protection cup about twice a day. But you may need to empty it more often during the first few days of your period if you bleed a lot.\n\nWash the cup with cold or hot water before reinserting it. \n\nWash the cup with soap and water once your period is over.

Here are examples of the types of help you can get:\n\nMost Youth Guidance Centres offer free condoms.\n\n## How much does it cost to visit a Youth Guidance Centre?\n\nIf you are under 18 years of age, you do not pay anything. At most clinics, you do not pay anything if you are over 18 years of age, either. At some clinics, a visit costs the same as a visit to a health clinic.\n\nWhen you are given a prescription for birth control or other medication, you pay for this when you collect the medication from a pharmacy. A prescription is a message from the clinic to the pharmacy.\n\nAt many Youth Guidance Centres, birth control is free, although, not at all of them.\n\n## What do I do if I want to visit a Youth Guidance Centre?\n\nYou have the freedom to go to the Youth Guidance Centre of your choice in Sweden.

It is important that you know where you can get help if you need it:\n\nMany young people in a similar situation are afraid of being treated badly, threatened or subjected to violence, or have their family turn their backs on them. Some are also afraid of being killed by someone in their immediate family or a relative.\n\nSome young people are afraid of being married off. Some young people are also afraid of being forced to see a doctor, psychologist or religious leader who will try to make them heterosexual.\n\nAll people have the right to their sexual orientation, gender identity and to dress the way they want. No one should have to deal with threats or violence. You have the right to feel good about yourself, and help is available. \n\n### Questions and answers\n\nHere you can read the queries sent in by young people to Ask UMO.

Everyone else seems to be having sex. I’ve never met anyone who wants to.\n\n## Answer\n\nMany other people wonder about this, too.\n\nIt’s very easy to believe that everyone else is having sex. Sometimes there’s a lot of talk about sex. However, the reality can be different. What is most important is to not have sex until both people want to.\n\nIf you walk up to a person and ask them if they want to have sex, probably nobody will say yes. Most people want to get to know each other first. Feeling ready to have sex can also be very different for different people. Usually you would have been in a relationship for a while.\n\nIs there someone you like very much? If so, it could be a good idea to try to get to know them better. Try and carefully find out if they are interested in you. You could begin by talking about normal things and show them that you care. For instance, ask them how they are, or whether they like school or work.\n\nIf the person seems happy talking to you, then you might ask them if they want to do something together with you. You could, for instance, meet for coffee or take a walk.\n\nYou can get to know new people in many ways, for example, at school or through friends. Or you could join an association or a club that has an activity you like. Then you can get to know someone who shares your interests.\n\n### Questio",

For example about what time you should come home at night, what clothes you wear or how you use social media. There’s no law that decides these things. Instead, you and your family have to come to an agreement.\n\n## What you get to decide\n\nYou have the right to decide certain things for yourself, even if you’re under the age of 18. For instance:\n\n## Right to go to school\n\nAll children in Sweden are required by law to attend school from Years 1 to 9. This means that you have to attend lessons, unless you’re ill. No-one is allowed to stop you going to school. No-one is allowed to stop you going to certain lessons. The same applies to school trips and work experience.\n\n## You decide whether to have sex\n\nYou have the right to masturbate or have sex in some other way, if you want to. You decide over your own body. No-one in your family or anyone else can forbid this.\n\nNo-one is able to tell whether or not you’ve had sex. It doesn’t show on your vagina or penis, or in any other way. There is no membrane that covers the opening of the vagina.\n\nYou can get protection against pregnancy, if you want it.\n\nYou don’t need permission from your parents or guardians, the person you are having sex with or the person you are married to.\n\n## You decide whether you want to get married\n\nYou should only get married if it’s because you want to, and if it’s with the person ",

Staff members are required to tell social services if they think that something bad is happening to you, such as someone being violent towards you.

But how can I help my mother?\n\n## Answer\n\nI understand that you want to help your mother, and that you don’t want to miss any more at school.\n\nYour mother has the right to an interpreter if needed, to be able to understand the information given to her and so that she can be understood by the health care professionals. An interpreter can be with your mother at the doctor’s instead of you.\n\nAn interpreter is a person who understands and speaks your mother’s native language. The interpreter will translate everything your mother says to the doctor and everything that the doctor says to your mother.\n\nYou can help your mother to ask for an interpreter next time she has to go and see the doctor. Contact the health centre that your mother will be going to, preferably as soon as she gets an appointment. Tell them that your mother needs an interpreter, and which language she speaks. The staff at the health centre will then organise an interpreter.\n\nIf you would like to, you can talk to your teacher about the test you missed. Explain why you missed the test.

What can I do?\n\n## Answer\n\nIt is a serious matter that you fear you will be forced into marriage. You need to talk to someone about this. Forcing someone to get married is a criminal offence in Sweden. No one can force you to do this. Not your parents, your siblings, relatives, friends or anyone else.\n\nI think you should talk to someone at a Youth Guidance Centre (ungdomsmottagning) about your fear of being forced into marriage. You can talk to the school nurse or school counsellor if you are at school. They can help you. There are organisations that work with matters like this and they can help you.\n\nYou can get help from social services (socialtjänsten) or the police if you need immediate help. Look up the number for the social services office in your municipality. The phone number to the police is 114 14. If you want to call the Swedish police from another country, the phone number is +46 77 114 14. \n\n### Film: You decide over your body\n\nEvery person has the right to make decisions regarding their own body.

Most people would feel the same way as you do in those difficult situations.\n\nIt can be easier to deal with difficult feelings like these if you take good care of yourself. Here are some tips:\n\nYou can also seek help at a Youth Guidance Centre (ungdomsmottagning). You can talk to someone there about your well-being, your feelings and thoughts.

Now I compare myself to him all the time. I really don’t want to be reminded of her life before she met me, because it makes me feel really jealous. What should I do?\n\n## Answer\n\nYou can’t change the fact that your girlfriend has been in relationships before you got together. You can, however, work on accepting this fact.\n\nIt’s easy to forget that you may also have your own memories of previous relationships. Is this the case for you?\n\nIt’s common to compare yourself with your partner’s ex. But, try to think about your own positive qualities. And try to remember that her ex-boyfriend is not a threat. You’re an entirely different guy. You’ve chosen each other, and you are the one she’s with. So enjoy that fact!\n\nYou can tell your girlfriend that seeing the photos was tough. But also tell her that it’s OK. We should all be allowed to keep our old photos.\n\nJealousy is something that most people feel at some point in time. But, being extremely jealous can be hard work - both for you and for the person you’re with.\n\nSometimes, jealousy can come from low self-esteem or thinking that you’re not good enough, as you are.\n\nYou can try to boost your self-esteem and think about liking yourself, just as you are. That will no doubt make you feel less jealous.",

In the evenings, I often drink beer so I can get to sleep. It works really well. I don’t get drunk, just relaxed so that I can fall asleep. How much can I drink before it becomes harmful to my body?\n\n## Answer:\n\nI don’t think you should drink any alcohol at all. All kinds and different amounts of alcohol do more harm than good for your body and your sleep. Even if you think that your mind is relaxed, your body isn’t relaxed in the same way. You need to urinate more when you drink alcohol than when you drink other beverages. When you get up at night to urinate, your deep sleep is interrupted, and you don’t sleep as well. \n\nThere are better ways of relaxing and sleeping properly. Try to go to bed at the same time every night, keep your bedroom cool and listen to relaxing music when you go to bed. Put away your mobile phone and turn off the computer a while before you go to bed.\n\nYou can also think about how you are feeling. Are you feeling stressed, anxious or angry about anything? Does this prevent you from relaxing? You can always contact a health clinic (vårdcentral) or a Youth Guidance Centre (ungdomsmottagning) and talk to a counsellor, a psychologist or a doctor there. They can certainly provide you with better help than any amount of beer.\n\n### Tips for sleeping better\n\nIt is important for your well-being that you get a good nights sleep. It is also howe",

How can I make new friends?\n\n## Answer\n\nMaking new friends is important when you come to a new country. Many people find that this isn’t so easy. A good idea is to say hello and talk to other people when you are somewhere where you want to get to know people.\n\nHave you started attending school? You will have opportunities to make new friends at school. If you find it difficult to get to know people at school, you can talk to an adult there, such as a teacher or a counsellor. Ask them if they can arrange activities at school or with other schools so that you and others get a chance to meet.\n\nThere is usually a youth recreation centre close to schools. This is for adolescents between the ages of around 13–18 years. Visit the centre, talk to the youth recreation leaders and take part in their activities if there is something that appeals to you.\n\nThere will undoubtedly be some clubs and associations in the town where you live, for instance, a sports club. Visit the club and see if you can join. Doing things together with others is usually fun and is a good way to make new friends. The counsellor at your school can help you find associations and clubs that interest you.\n\nSome municipalities and cities have places where you can go and meet people, for instance, language cafes and organisations that arrange meetings and activities.",

Reglerna varierar beroende på vad du köpt.\n\n#### Varor\n\nEnligt konsumentköplagen har du rätt att avbeställa en vara som inte har levererats. Men du kan behöva ersätta företaget för kostnader de får på grund av avbeställningen. Ersättningen avgörs från fall till fall och beror bland annat på hur nära leveransdatum du avbeställer. När du vill avbeställa är det är bra att kontakta företaget skriftligen.\n\n#### Tjänster\n\nDu har rätt att avbeställa vissa tjänster enligt konsumenttjänstlagen, så länge tjänsten inte är slutförd. Rätten att avbeställa gäller för arbete som utförs på lösa eller fasta saker. Exempel på sådana tjänster är:\n\nbilreparation (arbete på lös sak)\n\nnybyggnation av hus (arbete på fast sak)\n\nmåleriarbete (arbete på fast sak)\n\nstädtjänst (arbete på fast sak)\n\nOm du avbeställer kan du behöva ersätta företaget för kostnader de får på grund av din avbeställning, till exempel för arbete som redan är utfört. Ersättningen avgörs från fall till fall.

Öppet köp och bytesrätt är frivilligt att erbjuda. Det innebär att en del företag erbjuder 30 dagars öppet köp medan andra inte erbjuder öppet köp alls.\n\nFöretag kan också ha bestämmelser som säger att du till exempel inte får lämna tillbaka en vara om du öppnat förpackningen, tagit bort prislappen eller saknar kvitto.\n\nÖppet köp och bytesrätt\n\n### 1. Meddela företaget att du ångrar dig\n\nFör att du ska kunna bevisa att du har ångrat dig är det bäst att meddela företaget skriftligen, till exempel via mejl. Det finns inga särskilda krav på hur du ska formulera dig, utöver att det ska vara tydligt att du vill använda din ångerrätt.\n\nHar du fått en ångerblankett av företaget kan du använda den om du vill. Skickar du blanketten via brev till företaget är det bra att fota blanketten eller ta en kopia så att du har kvar underlag på att du har ångrat dig.\n\nFöretaget behöver inte bekräfta ditt meddelande om ångerrätt för att det ska gälla. Du förlorar alltså inte din ångerrätt om företaget inte svarar dig.\n\n#### Meddela företaget inom 14 dagar\n\nDet viktiga är att du kan bevisa att du har ångrat dig och att du har ångrat dig inom 14 dagar. Dagarna börjar räknas från dagen efter du tog emot eller hämtade ut varan.

I så fall behöver du meddela både företaget du handlat av och företaget du får fakturan av att du inte betalar.\n\n### 2.

Struntar du i att hämta ut varan riskerar du att få betala en avgift. När du hämtat ut varan behöver du sedan skicka tillbaka den till företaget.\n\nMeddelar företaget att du inte behöver hämta ut varan är det viktigt att få den informationen i skrift eller att det till exempel framgår av företagets köpevillkor.\n\n#### Då ska företaget återbetala dig\n\nNär du meddelar att du ångrar dig har företaget 14 dagar på sig att återbetala dig. En förutsättning för att du ska få återbetalning är att företaget fått tillbaka varan, eller att du kan visa att du skickat tillbaka den.\n\nDu ska få tillbaka pengarna på samma sätt som du betalade.

Då vänder du dig till tingsrätten. Det kostar pengar att lämna in en ansökan till domstol.\n\nÄr du osäker på om du ska vända dig till domstol eller behöver hjälp med att driva ditt fall, kan du ta hjälp av en jurist. När du funderar på att anlita juridisk hjälp kan du först kontakta ditt försäkringsbolag. I många hemförsäkringar finns ett så kallat rättsskydd. Det betyder att försäkringen kan täcka vissa kostnader i samband med juridiska processer.\n\nFör en tvist som rör ett krav under 28 650 kronor (ett halvt prisbasbelopp år 2024), ett så kallat förenklat tvistemål eller småmål, är ansökningsavgiften 900 kronor. Om kravet är över 28 650 kronor, eller om tvisten inte rör något bestämt belopp, är ansökningsavgiften 2 800 kronor.\n\nOm du förlorar tvisten kan du bli tvungen att betala både dina och företagets rättegångskostnader.

When opening a bank account, you need a passport, identity card for foreign citizens or some other official identity card. If you do not have a passport or identity card for foreign citizens, it is a good idea to check what kind of proof of identity the bank accepts. Some banks accept an alien's passport granted by a Finnish authority, a refugee travel document or other proof of identity which can be accepted as travel document. In some cases, the bank may also require other proof of identity if your document states that your identity could not be verified. It is a good idea to also acquire online banking credentials when opening a bank account. With online banking credentials you can, for example, attend to many official matters online. However, the requirements for obtaining online banking credentials are stricter than those for opening a bank account.

In these cases, the authorities will book you an interpreter and pay for the services.

In Finland, taxation of earned income is progressive. This means that you pay a larger share of tax on a larger salary than on a smaller salary. The tax rate indicates how much tax you pay on your income. It is calculated separately for each person in Finland. Your spouse’s income does not affect your tax percentage. You can estimate your own tax percentage using the Tax Administration’s calculator. If you receive a salary, the employer withholds the amount of tax directly from your salary and passes it on to the tax authorities. For that purpose, the employer must have your tax card. A tax card is a document that shows your tax rate. After each year, the Tax Administration calculates whether you have paid a sufficient amount of tax on your income. If you have paid too much tax, you will receive a tax refund. If you have paid too little tax, you will have to pay the missing amount in back taxes. Check your payslip and tax return to ensure that your employer has withheld tax from your salary and forwarded it to the tax authorities. Retain your payslips.

Finnish working culture Finnish working life has many rules that the employee and employer must follow. The legislation and collective agreements determine, for example, minimum wages, working hours, holidays, sick pay and the terms of dis­ missal. Equality and equal opportunities in working life According to Finnish law, all kinds of discrimination at workplaces is prohib­ ited. Employers must ensure that there is equality and equal opportunities for men and women at the workplace. Initiative and responsibility Work is usually arranged and agreed on at common meetings and jointly agreed matters are adhered to. A supervisor gives an employee their tasks and expects the employee to decide on the details of the work independently. If an employee does not know how to perform the given task or cannot do it, they ask their co-workers or the supervisor directly f",

Reliability and observing timetables In Finnish working culture, it is important to adhere to the things that have been agreed upon. When something has been decided together, the employ­ ees and employer assume that everyone will do what has been decided. Observing timetables is also important in Finland. You must arrive at work promptly at the agreed-upon time. When the agreement is 8:00, this means exactly 8:00, not 8:10. Being late is impolite because other people have to wait for the one who is late. If you know that you will be late for work, tell your supervisor about it.",

If a workplace uses flexible working hours, employees themselves have to make sure that they work for the length of time that has been agreed upon. Style of communication Finns usually speak out, and speaking out is not considered impolite in Finland. Saying what you mean is also normal in working life. For example, if you do not have enough time to complete a task, it is best to say so to your supervisor. At meetings, the usual procedure is to get straight to the point after greeting everybody. In Finnish working culture, the form of address is very informal. At most workplaces, all employees address each other using first names regardless of their position. The effect of religion on working life Many Finns are Christians but not very religious. However, many Christian customs are still observed in Finnish culture.

Approximately 87% of Finns speak Finnish as their native language. Approx­ imately 5% of Finns speak Swedish as their native language. When you are considering whether to study Finnish or Swedish, take the language that is spoken in your place of residence and neighbourhood into consideration. At most jobs, you need to know Finnish. If you want to study in Finland, you will probably need Finnish language skills. It is worthwhile studying Finnish or Swedish even if you do not intend on stay­ ing in the country for long. Even though Finns generally speak English quite well, knowing Finnish or Swedish will be very useful for you nonetheless. When you speak the language, you will become acclimatised more easily and will be more at home in Finland. It will be easier to attend to your affairs with authorities, keep abreast of the news, get to know people and make friends. The best way to learn a language is to take every opportunity to speak it. You don’t always have to understand every word; it is enough to understand the most important things. So be bold and enter situations where you can speak Finnish or Swedish.

Housing Housing in Finland Finland is one of the safest countries in the world, and all residential districts in Finland are safe to live in. Homes are well equipped and warm throughout the year, and even in cities, nature is nearby. Public transport works well in cities. Income differences in Finland are lower than in most other countries. This also shows in housing; differences between residential areas are not as great as in countries that have high income differences. Rental home In Finland, many people live in rental housing. The upside of renting is that switching flats is easy, as you do not have to sell your old home and buy a new one. On the other hand, your landlord may decide to terminate your lease if he or she has an acceptable reason for doing so. In such an eventu­ ality, you will be forced to move out of your flat even if you would not wish to. Reserve enough time for finding a flat. Some areas are extremely popular and any vacant flats are rented very quickly. When you have found a suitable place, you should quickly decide whether to rent it or not. According to Finnish law, a landlord choosing a tenant must not discriminate against anyone on the basis of factors such as ethnic origin, religion or nationality. How can I get a rental flat?

You do not need to use an agent to look for a flat. You can look for information on vacant flats yourself. In that case you do not need to pay a commission (välityspalkkio). Municipal rental housing Many municipalities own rental homes. They are often cheaper than other rental homes. Rental homes owned by municipalities are usually built with a state subsidy. This means that they are ARA homes. You can apply for state-subsidised rental housing if you have one of the following: • Finnish citizenship; • a registered right of residence; • a residence permit card; • a residence permit which is valid for at least 12 months; or • a student’s residence permit. If you would like to apply for a municipal rental flat, complete the application form at your municipality's housing agency. Many municipalities also offer online forms on their websites. ARA homes are meant for people with limited funds who need housing quickly. Municipalities can also have rental homes other than those built with a state subsidy.

The lease agreement contains information on, for example, the monthly rent, the rent security deposit and how to terminate the agreement. A tenancy agreement that is valid until further notice (toistaiseksi voimassa oleva vuokrasopimus) will only end once either the tenant or the landlord terminates it. If you do not know in advance how long you will stay in the dwelling, this kind of agreement is a good alternative. A fixed-term tenancy agreement (määräaikainen vuokrasopimus) means that the tenant and the landlord agree upon conclusion of the tenancy agreement when the agreement will end. A fixed-term tenancy agreement will automat­ ically end on the date specified in the agreement without separate notice. If you wish to continue staying in the dwelling after this, you need to make a new tenancy agreement. Rents are usually paid once a month. The rent must be paid by the latest on the due date. The due date is specified in the tenancy agreement. Pay the rent as a bank transfer to the landlord’s bank account. You cannot pay rent with a credit card. In addition to rent, you should reserve money for other expenses, too. Buying a home Housing shares are homes in either blocks of flats or terraced houses.

If a fire breaks out in your home, a smoke detector emits a loud alarm sound so that you can evacuate the premises in time. • Ensure that your home is equipped with a sufficient number of smoke detectors. Smoke detectors are sold in department stores and hardware shops. One smoke detector can cover up to 60 square metres. For example, if your home is 65 square metres in size, you will need two smoke detectors. If your home has more than one floor, calculate the floor area of each floor separately. There must be a smoke detector on every floor. • Check regularly that the smoke detector functions properly. Replace the batteries, if necessary – preferably once a year. • You are responsible for the smoke detectors even if you are living in a rental dwelling. • Finnish dwellings often have a sauna. Never place anything above the sauna heater even if you are not using the sauna, as this may cause a fire. For example, do not dry laundry above the sauna heater or near it. Always switch off an electric sauna heater after use. • When leaving your home, remember to check that the stove, sauna heater and iron, for example, have been switched off. • It is also a good idea to have a fire extinguisher in your home.

A child usually starts school in the year when they turn 7. These clinics monitor and support the physical, mental and social growth and development of young children. Children regularly visit a doctor or a nurse at a child health clinic.",

If an accident occurs at school, the child involved will be given first aid. The website of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health (Sosiaali- ja terveysmin­ isteriö) provides information about school health care. Vaccinations In Finland, children are offered the possibility of vaccination (rokotus) against many infectious and contagious diseases. Vaccinations are given at child health clinics (lastenneuvola) and in schools. Vaccinations that are a part of a vaccination programme are free of charge to the parents. Vaccinations are voluntary. The majority of children in Finland are given the vaccinations included in vaccination programmes. Tell the nurse which vaccinations your child has been given before coming to Finland.

A circumcision may only be performed by a qualified doctor. A written consent from the boy’s guardians is required for the circumcision.

However, getting dental care must take no longer than six months. In the evenings and at weekends, emergency care is centralised at larger units.

Discrimination refers to unequal treatment, i.e. treating one person more poorly than another in the same situation. Discrimination can be based on ethnic group, nationality or religion etc. Examples of discrimination include not getting service due to your ethnic origin, or being required to demonstrate perfect proficiency in Finnish at a job interview although the work itself does not require such skills. The Act prohibits discrimination based on age, origin, nationality, language, religion, belief, opinion, political activity, trade union activity, family circum­ stances, health, disability, sexual orientation or other personal characteris­ tics. No one must be put in a less favourable position due to these factors.

Examples of violence include: • intimidation, following, surveillance • subjugation and coercion • hitting, kicking and pushing • sexual violence In Finland, violence is a crime. Violence against one’s own family members is also a crime. Physical punishment of children, such as hitting them, is also a crime. A child finds physical punishment frightening. It is also detrimental to the child’s development and an ineffective way of punishing children. Help can be obtained by both the victim and the offender.

Pohdimme yhdessä koulun henkilöstön kanssa, miten jatkossa voisi ennaltaehkäistä vastaavia tapahtumia sekä ottaa asiaa puheeksi. Yhteistyössä toteutettiinkin syksyn aikana koulutukset aiheesta sekä oppilaille, vanhemmille että opetushenkilökunnalle. Koulutukset koettiin onnistuneiksi ja saimme niistä paljon hyvää palautetta niin oppilailta, opetushenkilökunnalta kuin vanhemmiltakin.\n\nVuoden aikana saimme monta uutta yhteydenottoa liittyen erilaisiin kouluissa ja netissä tapahtuneisiin seksuaalisen häirinnän tapauksiin. Mediassa velloi samaan aikaan Me too -kampanja ja keskustelut seksuaalisesta häirinnästä.

Yläkouluikäisistä pojista 12% ja toisen asteen opiskelijapojista 8% oli kokenut seksuaalista häirintää.(2) Suurin osa koetusta seksuaalisesta häirinnästä tapahtuu netissä tai julkisilla paikoilla. Helsingin Yliopistossa tehdyssä tutkimuksessa (2016) oli mukana 9. luokan oppilaita eri puolilta Suomea. Tutkimustulokset osoittivat, että 10% tytöistä ja 2% pojista oli joutunut aikuisen tekemän seksuaalisen häirinnän kohteeksi.(3) Yksityiskohtaisempaa tutkimustietoa seksuaalisesta häirinnästä on kuitenkin haasteellista löytää, mikä johtunee siitä, että aihe on monille seksuaalista häirintää kokeneille arka ja hyvin henkilökohtainen. Siihen saattaa liittyä myös paljon häpeää ja toisaalta myös tekijälle ja uhrille häirinnän raja saattaa olla hämärä.\n\n## Seksuaalinen häirintä digitaalisissa medioissa\n\nPelastakaa Lapset ry. toteutti seksuaalisesta häirinnästä ja siihen liittyvästä kiusaamisesta selvityksen (2018), jossa selvitettiin 12-17-vuotiaiden lasten kokemaa seksuaalista häirintää.

Häirintä on tyypillisesti toistuvaa, mutta myös yksittäinen tai huumoriksi tarkoitettu tahaton teko tai toiminta voi täyttää seksuaalisen häirinnän tunnusmerkistön laissa. Joskus nuori saattaa jakaa itse seksuaalista materiaalia vapaaehtoisesti vaikkapa seurustelusuhteessa. Seksuaalisesti rohkean ja paljastavan kuvamateriaalin harkitsematon jakaminen netissä lisää kuitenkin merkittävästi häirinnän ja kaltoinkohtelun riskiä. Seksuaaliseen häirintään voi liittyä myös kiusaamista. On tärkeää, että nuori ymmärtää oman vastuunsa myös netissä toimiessaan ja ymmärtää, että mikäli seksuaalisten kuvamateriaalien lähettämiseen liittyy painostamista ja kiusaamista, voi teko täyttää seksuaalisen häirinnän tunnusmerkit laissa. (5)\n\nPelastakaa Lapset ry:n selvityksessä kävi ilmi, että on varsin yleistä, että lapset ja nuoret näkevät myös toisiin lapsiin kohdistuvaa seksuaalista häirintää ja siihen liittyvää kiusaamista digitaalisessa mediassa (6).

Lukioikäisistä tytöistä noin puolet ja pojista n. 60% hyväksyi seksuaalisten kuvien lähettämisen. Nuorten asenteissa ja toiminnassa on kuitenkin nähtävissä ristiriitaa. Vaikka nuorista 90% koki, että toisilta saatua vähäpukeista kuvaa tai videota ei saa lähettää eteenpäin, niin kuitenkin n. 30% oli saanut puhelimeensa jonkun alastonkuvia tai videoita, tai nähnyt seksuaalissävytteisen kuvamateriaalin jakamista sosiaalisen median ryhmäkeskusteluissa.\n\n## Jokaisella on oikeus loukkaamattomuuteen – Mediakasvatustyö MLL:llä\n\nYK:n lapsen oikeuksien sopimus (LOS) on kaikkia alle 18-vuotiaita lapsia koskeva ihmisoikeussopimus (7). Se luettelee lapsille kuuluvat ihmisoikeudet ja asettaa valtioille ensisijaisen vastuun toteuttaa ne. Lapsilla on oikeus tulla suojelluksi kaikenlaiselta väkivallalta, seksuaaliselta riistolta ja häirinnältä.(8) Suomen perustuslaki turvaa jokaiselle myös perusoikeuksia. Laki määrää, että jokaista tulee kohdella tasa-arvoisesti yksilöinä ja yhdenvertaisina. Jokaisella on myös oikeus koskemattomuuteen ja turvallisuuteen. Aikuisen on tärkeää tiedostaa, että lapsella on oikeus lapsen oikeuksien toteutumiseen myös mediakulttuurissa ja digitaalisissa ympäristöissä. MLL:n mediaka",

MLL:n mediakasvatustyö edistää lasten, nuorten ja lapsiperheiden hyvinvointia monialaisesti.(9) Mediakasvatus, seksuaalikasvatus ja turvataitokasvatus sisältävät paljon yhteisiä rajapintoja ja niiden avulla vahvistetaan nuoren omia voimavaroja ja itsemääräämisoikeutta, lisätään tietoa lapsen oikeuksista ja tuetaan myös tunnetaitojen ja omanarvontunnon kehittymistä. Itsensä tuntemisen, omien rajojen ja niiden puolustamisen lisäksi nuoren on opittava myös kunnioittamaan toisten asettamia rajoja. Nuoruudessa koetun sukupuolisen häirinnän ja väkivallan on arvioitu olevan yksi vakavimmista uhriutumisen muodoista, kun huomioidaan teosta aiheutuvat seuraukset (10).\n\n## Lapsen oikeus - aikuisen velvollisuus\n\nLapsen oikeuksien sopimuksen 19. artiklan mukaisesti sopimusvaltioilla on velvollisuus ryhtyä koulutuksellisiin toimiin suojellakseen lasta mm. seksuaaliselta hyväksikäytöltä (11).

Lapset ja nuoret kertovat saaneensa vain vähän tietoa seksuaaliseen häirintään liittyvästä lainsäädännöstä, sekä siitä miten ja minne mahdollisesta seksuaalisesta häirinnästä voisi ilmoittaa. Huolestuttavaa oli, että vain hieman yli 10% yläkouluikäisistä ja vain 4% lukioikäisistä kertoisi seksuaalisesta häirinnästä aikuiselle (12). Myös opettajilla on liian vähän tietoa ja ymmärrystä käsitellä oppilaiden kokemaa seksuaalista häirintää.\n\nUskallamme puhua, kestämme kuulla! – Nuorten seksuaalisen häirinnän ehkäisy -hankkeessa lisätään lasten, nuorten ja aikuisten tietoisuutta seksuaalises",

Koronapandemian seuraukset, Venäjän hyökkäyssota Ukrainassa, sekä talous-, energia- ja ympäristökriisi haastoivat lasten ja nuorten mielenterveyttä sekä lapsiperheitä. Vuoden aikana aloitettiin myös uuden hyvinvointialueen rakentaminen.\n\nAlkuvuodesta 2023 aloitettiin vuosittainen alueen jäsenjärjestöjen tunnuslukujen kerääminen, jossa järjestöiltä kerättiin jälleen tietoa keskeisimmistä tunnusluvuista mm. rahoituksen, asiakasmäärien ja palveluiden osalta. Lisäksi raportti pitää tänäkin vuonna sisällään aluekohtaista tietoa järjestöjen toimintaympäristöstä. Kyselyyn vastasi yhteensä 37 järjestöä, mukaan lukien VSLJ.\n\nTunnuslukuraportti on VSLJ:n keskeisin vaikuttamistyön työnkalu, ja sitä hyödynnetään esimerkiksi kunta-, kansanedustaja- ja yliopistoyhteistyössä. Raportti on vapaasti myös jäsenjärjestöjen hyödynnettävissä.\n\n## Tuotoksena entistä laadukkaampi raportti\n\nTätä vuotta varten vastaamisen helpottamiseksi kyselylomaketta pyrittiin jälleen selkeyttämään, ja sopivissa määrin uudistamaan toimintaympäristön muutoksia ajatellen. Tiedonkeruussa kysyttiin ensimmäistä kertaa, perustuuko ilmoitettu lukema arvioon vai kerättyyn tietoon. Kohdattujen asiakkaiden lukumäärää koskevaa kysymystä on myös tarkennettu.

Muita keskeisiä uudistuksia ovat kysymykset digikohtaamisten lukumäärästä sekä siitä, minkä kuntien asukkaille järjestö on tarjonnut palveluitaan. Harmillisesti alueen kuntien lastensuojelun kokonaiskustannuslukuja ei ollut mahdollista sisällyttää tämän vuoden raporttiin.\n\nVSLJ kehittää raporttia vuosittain saadun palautteen perusteella, jotta luvuista saadaan entistä todenmukaisempia. Samalla kuitenkin säilytetään vertailukelpoisuus edellisten vuosien raportteihin. Tuloksissa on edelleen huomioitava järjestöjen monimuotoisuus sekä erot tilastoinnissa joidenkin kysymysten osalta, mutta kokonaisuutena tiedonkeruu otti jälleen askeleita eteenpäin, ja raportti on näin ollen entistä laadukkaampi ja todenmukaisempi.\n\n## Järjestöt ovat vaikuttava alueellinen toimija\n\nVuonna 2022 järjestöjen toiminnan piirissä oli peräti 79 000 yksittäistä asiakasta. Asiakaskohtaamisia vuorostaan oli 430 000, joista digitaalisesti tapahtui 37 000. Järjestöjen kohderyhmien ja palveluiden kirjo on laaja, ja yhteensä niiden parissa työskenteli viime vuonna noin 780 ammattilaista. Vapaaehtoisten joukko oli suuri (5800), ja kokemusasiantuntijoitakin järjestöillä oli noin 220.\n\nJärjestöjen palveluita oli saatavilla kaikissa Varsinais-Suomen kunnissa, ja niitä tarjottiin kaikkien kuntien asukkaille.

Hoitojärjestelmän palvelut koostuvat seitsemästä vauvalähtöisestä päihde-ensikodista ja kahdeksasta avopalveluyksiköstä sekä etsivästä ja matalan kynnyksen työstä.\n\nPidä kiinni® -hoitojärjestelmä syntyi, kun 80-luvulla hoitoon alkoi tulla yhä enemmän päihdeongelmista kärsiviä äitejä. Huomattiin, ettei päihdeongelmaisille äideille riitä vain vanhemmuuden tuki, vaan tukea tarvittiin yhtäaikaisesti sekä vanhemmuuteen että päihteettömyyteen. Turun ensikoti Pinja aloitti toimintansa 1999 ja avopalveluyksikkö Olivia muutamaa vuotta myöhemmin. Nykyään toiminta ei enää ole suunnattu vain äideille, vaan myös isät ovat tiiviisti mukana asiakkuuksissa.\n\n## Asiakkailla samat tavoitteet, erilaiset elämänkokemukset\n\nPinjan ja Olivian asiakasryhmät eroavat hieman toisistaan. Ensikoti Pinjan asiakkaista suurimmalla osalla on riippuvuustasoinen monipäihdeongelma, ja he elävät epävakaassa käyttökulttuurissa. Olivia-avoyksikön asiakkaat huolehtivat lapsistaan kotona käyden Oliviassa kolmesti viikossa, joten heillä ei ole aktiivista päihdeongelmaa, mutta he tar",

Olivia-avoyksikön asiakkaat huolehtivat lapsistaan kotona käyden Oliviassa kolmesti viikossa, joten heillä ei ole aktiivista päihdeongelmaa, mutta he tarvitsevat edelleen päihteettömään elämään ja vanhemmuuteensa tiivistä tukea. Asiakkaita kuitenkin yhdistää tarve pitkille kuntoutusjaksoille, sillä päihdeongelmat vaativat pitkäkestoista tukea.\n\nPidä kiinni® -hoitojärjestelmän asiakkailla on kaikilla oma, erilainen historiansa. Asiakkailla on kuitenkin usein taustallaan ylisukupolvista pahoinvointia, psyykkisiä sairauksia ja vaikeita elämänkokemuksia. Hoidon tavoitteena on päihdekuntoutuksen rinnalla tukea vanhemmuutta ja vauvan kehitystä, taata mahdollisimman pitkä päihteetön raskaus ja auttaa perheen vuorovaikutussuhteiden vahvistamisessa. Tavoitteena on myös ennaltaehkäistä huostaanotto ja mahdollistaa lapsen kasvu omien vanhempien luona. Lisäksi toiminnalla pyritään lisäämään vanhempien tietoutta siitä, miten päihteet vaikuttavat lapsen kehitykseen.\n\nTurun Pinjan ja Olivian yksiköiden asiakasmäärät ovat vuosien saatossa pysyneet melko samana. Ensikoti Pinja on suurimman osan ajasta täynnä, ja tarvittaessa asiakkaita ohjataan myös muihin ensikoteihin Suomessa. Oliviassa on hieman enemmän asiakaspaikkoja, ja yhteensä Pinjan ja Olivian Turun yksiköissä hoidetaan vuosittain noin 30 perhettä. Lisäksi etsivän ja matalan kynnyksen työn kautta tuetaan vuosittain kymmeniä perheitä, jotka eivät tarvitse tiivistä kuntoutusta. Se miten as",

Lisäksi etsivän ja matalan kynnyksen työn kautta tuetaan vuosittain kymmeniä perheitä, jotka eivät tarvitse tiivistä kuntoutusta. Se miten asiakkaat ohjautuvat avun piiriin riippuu pitkälti siitä, missä vaiheessa raskaus tulee ilmi, onko asiakkailla jo jokin olemassa oleva hoitokontakti ja tunnistetaanko heidän avun tarpeensa niissä. Neuvoloilla koetaan olevan erityisen suuri merkitys asiakkaiden tunnistamisessa.\n\n## Kuntoutus tarjoaa uuden mahdollisuuden koko perheelle\n\nPidä kiinni® on Suomessa ainoa hoitojärjestelmä, jossa hoidetaan samanaikaisesti sekä päihteettömyyttä että varhaista vuorovaikutusta. Yksiköiden tekemä työ tuskin tulee vähenemään tulevaisuudessa, sillä tutkimusten mukaan jopa 6 %:lla raskaana olevista on päihdeongelma. Yli 20 vuotta jatkunut työ on mahdollistanut lukuisille lapsille mahdollisuuden kasvaa omien vanhempiensa kanssa ja katkaissut ylisukupolvisten ongelmien jatkuvuuden. Aina huostaanotoilta ei vältytä, mutta niissäkin tapauksissa on usein pystytty pitkittämään päihteetöntä raskausaikaa. Perheitä kuitenkin voidaan kuntouttaa ja raskaus tarjoaa usein mahdollisuuden muutokselle. Luonnollisesti kaikki edellä mainitut hyödyt tuovat säästöjä yhteiskunnalle, vaikkakin toiminnan ensisijainen tavoite on kuitenkin vähentää inhimillistä kärsimystä ja taata hyvä elämä niin lapsille kuin heidän vanhemmilleen menneisyyden tapahtumista huolimatta.\n\nSekä Pinjan että Olivian yksiköiden tavoitteena onkin",

Kuuluvuuden kokemus määritellään yksilön tunteeksi siitä, että hän on hyväksytty ja pidetty, tuntee yhteyttä muihin ja tuntee olevansa osa yhteisöä (1).\n\nNuorten koulussa koetun osallisuuden tiedetään olevan yhteydessä muun muassa opiskelumotivaatioon (2), opintomenestykseen (3), itsetuntoon ja yleiseen hyvinvointiin. Sen sijaan osattomuuden kokemus koulu- ja luokkayhteisössä on yhteydessä masennus- ja ahdistusoireisiin, heikompaan itsetuntoon, heikompaan koulumenestykseen (4), käyttäytymisen haasteisiin, yksinäisyyden ja vieraantuneisuuden kokemuksiin (5), sekä kohonneeseen koulupudokkuusriskiin (6). Kuuluvuuden kokemuksen koulussa katsotaan olevan edellytys kokonaisvaltaiselle kouluhyvinvoinnille.\n\nTutkimus on toistuvasti osoittanut heikon aseman sosiaalisessa hierarkiassa laukaisevan ihmisessä häpeää ja stressiä ja vaikuttavan negatiivisesti emotionaaliseen ja psyykkiseen terveyteen ja itsetuntoon. Yksilöillä on myös havaittu olevan taipumus kehittää itsekäsityksiä, jotka vastaavat, oikeuttavat ja uudelleentuottavat yhteiskuntamme hierarkioita (7). Matala sosioekonominen ",

Matala sosioekonominen asema voi tuottaa itsekäsityksen, jota jotkut tutkijat ovat kuvanneet käsiteparilla ”aliarvioitu itse” (eng. undervalued self) (8). Voidakseen tuntea kuuluvuutta ja yhteyttä muihin, ihmisen täytyy kuitenkin ensin voida tuntea olevansa turvassa niin suhteessa yhteisöönsä, kuin suhteessa itseensä (9).\n\n## Perheen heikko taloudellinen tilanne kasvattaa nuorten riskiä kokea osattomuutta luokkayhteisössä\n\nTutkimustulostemme mukaan perheen heikko taloudellinen tilanne heijastuu negatiivisesti nuoren osallisuuden kokemukseen luokkayhteisössä. Lasten maailmassa taloudellisen puutteen on havaittu ilmentyvän erityisesti sosiaalisissa suhteissa ja erityisesti niiden lasten kanssa, jotka omaavat enemmän taloudellisia resursseja. Samankaltaiset resurssit liimaavat ystäviä yhteen (10) erityisesti nuorten keskuudessa sekä koulussa, että vapaa-ajalla (11). Aiempi tutkimus on osoittanut, että merkittävimpiä resursseja ovat ne, jotka on helppo tehdä näkyviksi (12). Huolimatta maailman tasa-arvoisimmasta koulutusjärjestelmästä, materiaaliset resurssit heijastuvat myös koulumaailmassa koettuun osallisuuteen.\n\n”Huolimatta maailman tasa-arvoisimmasta koulutusjärjestelmästä, materiaaliset resurssit heijastuvat myös koulumaailmassa koettuun osallisuuteen.”\n\nTulostemme mukaan vanhempien koulutustasolla e",

Tulosta voidaan pitää yllättävänä erityisesti lukiolaisia koskien, sillä vanhempien korkean koulutustason tiedetään olevan voimakkaasti yhteydessä lukio-opiskeluun. Vanhempien koulutustaso on kuitenkin saattanut menettää merkitystään yleisen koulutustason nousun myötä. Sekä perheen taloudellista tilannetta, että vanhempien koulutustasoa mitattiin nuoren itsensä arvioimana.\n\n## Taloudellisen tilanteen ja osallisuuden kokemuksen välinen yhteys vahvinta yläkouluikäisillä\n\nYhteys perheen taloudellisen tilanteen ja nuoren luokkayhteisössä kokeman osallisuuden välillä on voimakkain yläkoululaisten, toisiksi voimakkain lukiolaisten ja heikoin ammattikoululaisten keskuudessa. Tutkimusaineistossamme ammattikoululaiset vaikuttaisivat ylipäätään kokevan osattomuutta luokkayhteisöissään muita nuoria harvemmin.\n\nYläkouluikäisten voimakas yhteys perheen heikon taloudellisen tilanteen ja osattomuuden kokemuksen välillä voi selittyä iällä: 14- ja 15-vuotiaat elävät ajanjaksoa, jolloin he ensimmäistä kertaa alkavat ottaa etäisyyttä lapsuudenperheisiinsä ja luomaan omaa identiteettiään.

Samanaikaisesti tämän ikäiset nuoret ovat kuitenkin voimakkaan riippuvaisia vanhemmistaan ja kyvyttömiä vaikuttamaan omaan tai perheensä taloudelliseen tilanteeseen.\n\nEroa ammattikoululaisten ja lukiolaisten välillä ei kuitenkaan voida selittää iällä. Ammattikoululaiset jakautuvat opiskelulinjoillensa erityisten kiinnostuksenkohteidensa mukaisesti, mikä saattaa selittää korkeampaa osallisuuden kokemusta. Samaa alaa opiskelevien keskuudessa voi olla helpompaa tuntea yhteisyyttä perhetaustoista riippumatta. Luokattoman lukion toimintaihanne sitä vastoin saattaa heikentää sosiaalista koheesiota lukioissa.\n\nSosiaaliluokan mukainen eriytyminen ammattikoululaisten ja lukiolaisten välillä näkyy tutkimusaineistossa siten, että ammattikoulussa opiskelevat arvioivat muita useammin perheensä taloudellisen tilanteen heikoksi. Sosiaalisten hierarkioiden rakentumista kuvaaviin teorioihin nojaten voidaan arvella, ettei heikko taloudellinen tilanne kenties aiheuta yhtä voimakkaita leimautumisen tai ulkopuolisuuden kokemuksia ammatillisissa oppilaitoksissa, kuin lukioissa. Tutkimuksemme antaa tukea kyseiselle tulkinnalle: perheen heikko taloudellinen tilanne ei heijastu nuoren osallisuuden kokemukseen yhtä voimakkaasti ympäristössä, jossa taloudellinen tilanne arvioidaan keskimäärin heikoksi.\n\nTuloksia tulkittaessa tulee ottaa huomioon myös aineiston sekä",

Tulevaisuudentutkimuksen mukaan tulevaisuudessa uusliberalistinen ajattelun rinnalle nousisi entistä vahvemmin tahto olla mukana hyvässä. Tulevaisuudessa mielekkyyttä siis haetaan entistä enemmän osallistumisesta hyvään sekä toisen auttamisesta, ja palautteena saatu kiitos toimii parhaana ja riittävänä palkkiona. Tämä kiitollisuustaloutta yksinkertaistettuna.\n\nTulevaisuutta ei vain ennusteta, sitä myös tehdään. Sillä mihin ilmiöön lähdemme mukaan ja mihin yhdessä panostamme voi olla merkitystä tulevaisuuden muotoutumisen kannalta, myös alueellisesti. Kiitollisuustalous on siis tunnistettu tulevaisuuden ilmiöksi. Järjestöjen olisi siksi hyvä pohtia miten yhdessä lähdemme vahvistamaan tätä signaalia yhteisen hyvän kasvattamiseksi.\n\n## Vapaaehtoistyön muodot ja merkitys\n\nJärjestöjen vapaaehtoiset tekevät työtä osallistuakseen hyvän tekemiseen, ollakseen avuksi ja vaikuttaakseen tämän hetken olosuhteiden parantamiseen. Palkkiona annetusta ajasta ja tehdystä työstä saadaan mielekkyyden ja osallisuuden kokemuksia. Vapaaehtoiset ovat usein järjestöjen sydän. Mitä kiitollisuustalouden tuleminen tarkoittaa tulevaisuudessa vapaaehtoistyölle?\n\nVapaaehtoistyön tulevaisuudesta on puhuttu, että vapaaehtoiset eivät olisi enää yhtä kiinnittyneitä pitkiin prosesseihin kuin nyt ja tekijöitä ei riittäisi pyörittämään vapaaehtoisvoimilla toimivien",

Onko tulevaisuutta nopeatempoisuus ja lyhyet vapaaehtoistyökeikat? Siis se, että katsotaan päivätasolla mihin aikaansa haluaa kyseisenä iltana antaa? Tämä on yksi näkemys tulevaisuudesta. Sosiaalinen media sovelluksineen antaisi tähän jo nyt mahdollisuuden.\n\nVuonna 2015 turvapaikanhakijoiden aalto loi tarpeen koordinoida auttamis- ja osallistumishaluisten työpanosta nopealla sykkeellä. Vaihtoehtoja oli tarjolla runsaasti: lähtisinkö tänään pelaamaan jalkapalloa nuorten turvapaikanhakijoiden kanssa, lajittelemaan vaatteita vai muokkaamaan lapsiystävällistä tilaa? Auttamishalussa ja sen kanavoitumisessa oli tekemisen meininkiä, joka tuntui hyvälle.\n\nOn hienoa, jos erilaisten osallistumismuotojen laajentuva kirjo ja teknologia madaltaa auttamishaluisten osallistumisen kynnystä tulevaisuudessa. Samalla tavalla tuntuu hyvältä, kun kuulen tukihenkilön tunteikasta palautetta lapsesta tai nuoresta, jonka rinnalla hän on kulkenut vuosia. Se, miten paljon yhteinen matka on rikastuttanut molempia, herkistää.\n\n## Tulevaisuus tehdään\n\nTulevaisuudentutkimuksen mukaan mielekkyyden kokemukset nousevat nykyistä merkittävämpään asemaan.

Menetelmien avulla selvitetään, miten lapsen kehitystä voidaan tukea mahdollisesti toimintaterapialla. Arviointi kartoittaa lapsen toimintakykyä monipuolisesti.

Tässä on minun tarinani, yksi monesta, joka olisi voinut päättyä toisin Sporttikummin avulla.\n\n## 11-vuotiaan tytön unelma sählystä\n\nMuistan sen hyvin, olin 11-vuotias, aika ujo tyttö vielä, eikä liikunta itsessään kiinnostanut minua tässä vaiheessa niin kovasti. Ulkoilun ja liikkumisen sijasta jäin mieluummin yksin kotiin koulun jälkeen leipomaan muffineja ja tuijottamaan telkkaria. Eikä tuolloin ollut ketään kotonakaan kannustamassa minua lähtemään ulos leikkimään tai liikkumaan, koska vanhempani olivat aina iltamyöhään töissä.\n\nKoulun liikuntatunnilla innostuin kuitenkin pelaamaan sählyä, joka oli ainoa laji, josta olin saanut myönteisiä elämyksiä ja onnistumisen kokemuksia. Muistaakseni vanhempani olivat jonkin verran ilahtuneita, kun sovittiin, että aloittaisin sähly-harrastuksen.\n\nPienessä kylässä harrastusmahdollisuuksia oli rajallisesti ja lähin mahdollinen sählyharrastus oli viereisen kylän yläasteen tyttöjen joukkueessa. Muistan, että kun asiaa ensi kertaa ehdotettiin, olin jo peruttamassa lupaukseni harrastuksen aloittamisesta. Mutta äitini oli järjestänyt, että pääsisin koulubussilla jatkamaan urheiluhallille asti, joten en uskaltanut kertoa sisälläni kasvavasta ahdistuksesta ja pelosta.

Ymmärrätte varmaan, että oli suurin painajainen joutua aloittelijana tuntemattomien vanhempien tyttöjen joukkueeseen. Ensimmäisellä bussimatkalla urheiluhalliin, joka tuli olemaan myös viimeinen, jouduin keräämään itselleni sen verran rohkeutta, että uskalsin perille päästyäni edes kysyä vahtimestarilta missä tyttöjen pukuhuone sijaitsisi.\n\nPukuhuoneessa ei minun lisäkseni ollut muita ja se muutaman viikon vatsassa pyörinyt kivi alkoi painaa entistä enemmän. Epäröimisestä huolimatta vaihdoin kuitenkin vaatteet ja sidoin vanhat sisäpelitossuni. Vilkuilin itsenäni peilistä ja pohdin lapsen tavalla, olisinko minä riittävän hyvä?\n\nPukuhuoneesta avasin oven raolleen jumppasalaiin, jossa yllätykseksi treenit olivat jo alkaneet. Tämä aiheutti minulle ihan toisen tason kauhureaktion ja ajatukset syyllisyydestä ja epävarmuudesta alkoivat pyöriä päässäni. Oman ahdistuksesta ja pelosta johtuen en loppujen lopuksi ikinä uskaltanut osallistua sählytuntiin. Ja muistikuvat ovat aika sumuiset siitä, mitä tapahtui sen jälkeen, kun suljin oven. Muistan vain, että bussikuljettaja ei kehdannut olla ottamatta rahatonta hätääntyneesti itkevää tyttöä kyytiin.\n\n## Turvallinen aikuinen tukena\n\nTilanne olisi varmaan päättynyt aivan eri tavalla, jos olisin saapunut paikalle yhdessä turvallisen aikuisen kanssa.

Tyttöjen Talo on toiminut Turussa jo kymmenen vuotta ja toiminta on sukupuoli- ja kulttuurisensitiivistä. Aihetta on pohdittu vuosien saatossa monesta eri näkökulmasta ja seuraavassa määritelmämme sukupuolisensitiivisyydestä sekä kokemuksiamme käytännön työstä.\n\n## Sukupuolisensitiivisyys\n\nSukupuolisensitiivisyys tarkoittaa kykyä huomioida sukupuoli ja sen moninaisuus. Työotteessa tunnistetaan sukupuolten erot, mutta niiden rooliodotukset kyseenalaistetaan. Sukupuolisensitiivisyys on aika- ja paikkasidonnaista, jolloin työote tarvitsee jatkuvaa tarkastelua. Sukupuolisensitiivisessä työotteessa ei kannusteta normivastaisuuteen, vaan sen tarkasteluun. Sukupuolisensitiivisyys sekoitetaan usein sukupuolineutraaliuteen, mutta sukupuolineutraalius on ajattelutapa, jossa sukupuolta ja sen erilaisia merkityksiä ei oteta toiminnassa huomioon.\n\nKäytännön työssä sukupuolisensitiivisyys näkyy Tyttöjen Talon toiminnassa, Turun keskustassa ja Varissuon lähiössä, työotteessa ajatusmaailmaa avartaen. Esimerkkinä tästä ovat ammatti-illat, joissa miesvaltaisilla aloilla työskentelevät naiset kertovat itsestään. Turun Tyttöjen Talolla on eritaustaisia naisia töi",

        "content": ", työotteessa ajatusmaailmaa avartaen. Esimerkkinä tästä ovat ammatti-illat, joissa miesvaltaisilla aloilla työskentelevät naiset kertovat itsestään. Turun Tyttöjen Talolla on eritaustaisia naisia töissä ja vapaaehtoisina esikuvina eri tavoista olla nainen. Ohjaajan sanat ja käytös ovat merkityksellisiä kävijöille, joten ohjaajalta vaaditaan omien normien ja käsitysten tarkastelua. Sillä, onko ohjaaja kannustava vai lannistava tai vahvistaako stereotypioita, on merkityksellistä tytölle, joka pohtii itseään ja omaa identiteettiään.\n\nTyttöjen Talolla on tärkeää, että jokainen saa olla juuri sellainen kuin on. Talolla saa käydä myös ne, jotka kokevat itsensä tytöksi vaikka olisivat pojan kehossa. Kävijät uskaltavat tuoda esiin kysymyksiä sukupuoleen liittyen ja pohtia niitä ohjaajan ja muiden kävijöiden kanssa kaikessa toiminnassa ja sen lomassa.\n\n## Sukupuolieriytetty toiminta\n\nSukupuolisensitiivinen toiminta Tyttöjen Talon kontekstissa on sukupuolieriytettyä eli toiminta on ainoastaan tytöille ja nuorille naisille. Sukupuolieriytetty toiminta edistää tasa-arvokehitystä, kun eriytetty tila mahdollistaa tietyistä teemoista keskustelun, esim. kuukautiset, äitiys, raskaus, kunniakulttuurien odotukset tyttöjä kohtaan jne. Tyttöjen Talolla kävijöitä yhdistää ainakin yksi asia: tyttöys. Kun ymmärtää omaa sukupuoltaan ja sukupuolen moninaisuutta, voi ymmärtää paremmin muita sukupuolia. Nykypäivän yhteiskunnassa sukupuolet eivät ole täysin tasa-arvoisia, esim. harrastusmahdollisuuksien",

Jos ainoa mahdollisuus harrastaa on käydä Tyttöjen Talolla, silloin ei ole kyse poikia syrjivästä paikasta, vaan paikasta, joka mahdollistaa tytön olla osa yhteiskuntaa ympärillään.\n\nMonille maahanmuuttajataustaisille, kunniakulttuurin maista tuleville vanhemmille on tärkeää, että tytär käy sukupuolieriytetyssä toiminnassa, jossa myös ohjaajat ovat naisia. Vapaa-ajan viettäminen samassa tilassa poikien kanssa koetaan tytön siveydelle ja perheen maineelle haitallisena.\n\n## Kulttuurisensitiivisyys\n\nKulttuurisensitiivisyys vaatii omien normien sekä oman kulttuurin ymmärtämistä ja kriittistä tarkastelua. On tiedettävä ja ymmärrettävä toisesta kulttuurista tulevan henkilön tavoista, vaikka ei itse sitä ajatusta hyväksy. Tällöin ei kauhistella tai päivitellä toisen pukeutumista tai käytöstä, vaan annetaan vertailupohja eli kerrotaan, mikä on valtakulttuurin tapa ja annetaan erilaisia vaihtoehtoja tilanteissa toimimiseen. Kulttuurisensitiiviselle työotteelle on ominaista kunnioitus toisten valintoja kohtaan sekä tieto siitä, mikä ero on kulttuurin ja uskonnon vaikutuksilla. Haastavinta kulttuurisensitiivisyydessä on erot mm. siveellisyyskäsityksissä, esiaviollisessa seksissä ja seurustelussa. Ihmisen omaan kulttuuriin vaikuttaa hän itse, hänen yhteisönsä sekä yhteiskunta. Kul",

Kulttuurisensitiivisesti toimiessaan ohjaaja ei saa olettaa toisesta mitään, mutta on hyvä olla tietoinen eri kulttuureista ja kysellä kunnioittavasti, jos on epäselvyyksiä.\n\nSe, miten kulttuurisensitiivisyys näkyy, on tilannekohtaista. Varissuon toiminnassa ei mainosteta erikseen monikulttuurisuutta, sillä halutaan myös kantasuomalaisia mukaan. Keskustan Tyttöjen Talolla taas tuodaan esiin monikulttuurisuus, jotta yhteistyötahot osaisivat ohjata tyttöjä toimintaan. Ryhmien nimillä on myös vaikutusta; monikulttuurista \"Mahtavat\" -ryhmää mainostetaan suomen kielen ryhmänä, ei kulttuuriryhmänä. Kulttuurisensitiivinen työote ottaa huomioon myös nuorisokulttuurit, esim. Tyttöjen Talon Otakut-ryhmä, joka keskittyy japanilaiseen kulttuuriin, animeen ja mangaan. Ehkä konkreettisimmin ja vaikuttavimmin kulttuurisensitiivisyys näkyy välipalapöydässä, jossa jokaiselle on syötävää vakaumuksesta riippumatta, esim. muslimit eivät syö sianlihaa ja vegaanit eivät mitään eläinkunnan tuotetta.

Kotoa kouluun -perhevalmentajat työskentelevät alakouluikäisten lasten ja heidän perheidensä kanssa selvittämällä syitä koulupoissaolojen taustalla ja auttamalla koulunkäynnin mahdollistumista.\n\n## Jatko turvattu lukuvuoden 2024–2025 loppuun\n\nToimintamallin kehittäminen on käynnistynyt vuonna 2021 turkulaisten säätiöiden ja Turun kaupungin rahoittamana. Vuosina 2023–2024 Kotoa kouluun -toiminnalla on ollut STEA:n hankerahoitus. STEA-rahoitus on nyt päättymässä, sillä järjestörahoituksen leikkausten vuoksi vuodelle 2025 STEA:sta ei ollut haettavissa jatkorahoitusta toimintaan.\n\nJatkon turvaamiseksi olemme neuvotelleet Turun kaupungin kanssa rahoituksesta ja iloksemme saaneet vihreää valoa jatkolle. Turun kaupungin näkemyksen mukaan Kotoa kouluun -toiminnalla on merkittävä rooli lasten ja nuorten syrjäytymisen ehkäisemisessä; sen avulla on voitu auttaa toista sataa perhettä tukemaan lapsensa paluuta takaisin kouluun pitkittyneiden poissaolojen jälkeen. Kaupunki on sitoutunut rahoittamaan tarpeelliseksi ja tulokselliseksi todettua toimintaa ainakin lukuvuoden 2024–2025 loppuun.

Some voidaan jakaa viestintäalustoihin (esim. Whatsapp ja Chat), verkostoitumisalustoihin (esim. Facebook ja Twitter), kuva-alustoihin (esim. Pinterest ja Instagram) sekä videoalustoihin (esim. Snapchat ja Youtube). Lisäksi somen alla voidaan puhua sellaisista peleistä, joissa ollaan vuorovaikutuksessa muiden pelaajien kanssa netin välityksellä (esim. Warcraft ja Fortnite). Somen käyttö ei olekaan yhtenäinen kokonaisuus vaan eri nettialustoilla on erilaiset tarkoituksensa ja erilaiset käyttäjänsä. Mikään somen osa-alue ei ole sellaisenaan hyödyllisempi tai haitallisempi kuin jokin toinen, vaan keskeisempää on niiden asia- ja vuorovaikutussisällöt.\n\n### Miten tytöt ja pojat eroavat somen käyttäjinä?\n\nKansainvälisissä nuorten somen käyttöä koskevissa tutkimuksissa on tarkasteltu eroja tyttöjen ja poikien nettikäyttäytymisessä. Havaintojen mukaan pojat ja tytöt käyttävät tyypillisesti sosiaalista mediaa eri tavoin. Pojat esimerkiksi käyttävät nettipeleihin kaksinkertaisen ajan tyttöihin verrattuna. Suomessa 10-19 -vuotiaista yli 50 % pelaa päivittäin. Pelaaminen muodostaa ja muotoilee sosiaalisia suhteita sekä netissä että reaalimaailmassa. Peliyhteisöt luovat nuorelle yhteenkuuluvuuden tunnetta, mutta pelitietämys vaikuttaa statukseen ja sosiaalisiin suhteisiin ",

Peliyhteisöt luovat nuorelle yhteenkuuluvuuden tunnetta, mutta pelitietämys vaikuttaa statukseen ja sosiaalisiin suhteisiin myös esimerkiksi koulussa.\n\nVaikka tytötkin pelaavat, käyttävät he usein poikia enemmän somessa aikaa yhteydenpitoon ikätovereiden kanssa erilaisilla keskustelu-, kuva- ja videoalustoilla. Suurin osa nuorista käyttää somea ollakseen yhteydessä ikätovereihinsa, joita he tapaavat myös reaalielämässä. Somea käytetään siis jatkeena olemassa oleville sosiaalisille suhteille. Kuitenkin lähes puolet on ollut somen kautta yhteydessä myös heille muusta elämästä tuntemattomiin henkilöihin. Nämä uudet kontaktit liittyvät tyypillisimmin yhteiseen kiinnostuksen kohteeseen, kuten jaettuun harrastukseen.\n\nSomen käytön riskit tytöille ja pojille ovat tutkimusten mukaan myöskin erilaisia. Tytöt ovat poikia alttiimpia luomaan somen vaikutuksesta epärealistisia odotuksia ihanneminästään ja esimerkiksi omasta kehostaan. Profiilien rakentaminen ja nettisivustojen mahdollistama näkyvä palaute saattaa aiheuttaa tarvetta antaa omasta elämästään todellista menestyksekkäämmän kuvan. Tutkimusten mukaan tytöt ja pojat kokevat, että heidän elämänsä netissä ei anna kuvaa heidän todellisesta minästään, koska tavoitteena on kerätä esimerkiksi seuraajia ja tykkäyksiä. Epätodellisen kuvan luominen ja ylläpitäminen voi vaikeuttaa identiteetin löytymistä myös muussa elämässä.\n\nPojat korvaavat tyttöjä useammin reaal",

Epätodellisen kuvan luominen ja ylläpitäminen voi vaikeuttaa identiteetin löytymistä myös muussa elämässä.\n\nPojat korvaavat tyttöjä useammin reaalielämän suhteita nettikontakteilla ja saattavat eristää itseään kasvokkaisesta vuorovaikutuksesta. Kasvokkainen vuorovaikutus on kuitenkin tärkeää kehon ja eleiden sanattoman viestinnän oppimiseksi sekä empatian ja tunteiden erottamiskyvyn vahvistamiseksi. Somen mahdollisuus nimettömyyteen tai keksittyyn nimimerkkiin lisää riskejä sekä tytöillä että pojilla. Some on luonut maailman, jossa toisia ihmisiä kommentoidaan julmasti ja usein matalammalla kynnyksellä kuin reaalielämässä. Esimerkiksi nettikiusaamisessa kiusaaja ei saa välitöntä kokemusta siitä, mitä kiusaaminen saa aikaan kiusatussa. Lisäksi nimettömyys mahdollistaa aikuisten yhteydenotot alaikäisiin esimerkiksi seksuaalisessa tarkoituksessa.\n\n### Miten nuorten somen käyttöön voi aikuisena vaikuttaa?\n\nTutkimusten mukaan aikuisten merkitys sosiaalisen median käyttöön on pääsääntöisesti sitä vähentävä ja ikätovereiden sitä lisäävä. Aikuisten mahdollisuuksia vaikuttaa lasten ja nuorten somen käyttöön lisäävät aktiivinen pyrkimys pysyä tietoisena netin ajankohtaisista nuoria kiinnostavista sisällöistä kuten erilaisista viestintäalustoista ja nettipeleistä.

Lisäksi on hyödyllistä olla tietoinen nuorten somen ja netin käytön ajallisesta kestosta sekä siitä, milloin ja mihin tarkoitukseen somea ja nettiä käytetään. Aikuisten vaikuttaminen lasten ja nuorten somen käyttöön voidaan jakaa neljään ohjaamistapaan: aktiiviseen vaikuttamiseen, yhteiskäyttöön, valvovaan tarkkailuun ja rajojen asettamiseen. Yksiselitteistä näyttöä ei kuitenkaan ole siitä, mikä keinoista on lasten ja nuorten turvalliseen somen käytön ohjaamiseen tehokkain, sillä jokainen lapsi ja perhe on erilainen. Kaikkien tapojen tehokkuuteen vaikuttaa kuitenkin keskeisesti lapsen ja aikuisen vuorovaikutussuhteen ja keskusteluyhteyden yleinen laatu ja toimivuus.\n\nYksi tapa vaikuttaa nuoren ja samalla kaikkien perheenjäsenten somessa käyttämään aikaan on lisätä perheen yhteistä vapaa-ajan viettoa, mikä sekä houkuttelee muihin aktiviteetteihin että rajaa somen käyttöä. Tarvittaessa netinkäyttöä voi pyrkiä rajaamaan konkreettisemminkin sekä ajallisesti että sisällöllisesti. Sosiaalisen median käyttöä voi rajata ajallisesti tiettyyn minuutti- tai tuntimäärään taikka paikkasidonnaisesti esimerkiksi keittiön ja makuuhuoneiden ulkopuolelle. Sisältöjä voidaan rajata erilaisilla filttereillä, jotka suojaavat esimerkiksi alaikäisiltä kielletyiltä sivustoilta.

Toimivan vuorovaikutussuhteen ja luottamuksen puuttuessa rajat saattavat jopa lisätä nuorten riskikäyttäytymistä netissä, mikäli ne johtavat netinkäytön salaamiseen ja siitä valehteluun.\n\n### Mitä some hyödyttää ja miten sen riskejä voi hallita?\n\nRiskeistä huolimatta somesta on myös paljon hyötyä. Se tarjoaa nuorille mahdollisuuden pitää yhteyttä ikätovereihin reaalikontakteja monipuolisemmin, saada ikätovereilta tai erilaisilta tukiyhteisöiltä apua sekä olla luovia ja toteuttaa itseään. Some muun muassa mahdollistaa samanhenkisten nuorten tutustumisen toisiinsa asuinpaikasta riippumatta sekä itseilmaisun harjoittelun välittämättä reaalimaailmaan muodostuneista sosiaalisista rooleista. Kohtuullinen ikärajoja noudattava pelaaminen tai esimerkiksi tubettaminen voidaan myös lukea harrastukseksi ja tavaksi rentoutua. Nuoret käyttävät somea myös oppimistarkoituksiin sekä osana opintoja että vapaa-ajan tiedonhakua. Ohjaamisessa turvalliseen nettikäyttäytymiseen on siis tärkeää ymmärtää myös nuorten tarve sosiaalisen median käytölle ja sen tuomat edut. Nuorten maailma on osittain siirtynyt someen, joten sen käytön kohtuuton rajoittaminen saattaa eristää haitallisella tavalla ikätovereista.\n\nItsetunnon vahvistaminen ja sosiaalisten taitojen opettelu on tärkeää sosiaalisen median ongelmakäytön ennaltaehkäisemiseksi.

Tutkimusten johtopäätöksenä voidaan tunnistaa teemoja, joista nuorten kanssa on lisäksi somen käyttöön liittyen tärkeää keskustella:\n\nNuorten someasenteisiin on tärkeää pyrkiä vaikuttamaan sekä yhteisöllisesti esimerkiksi mediakasvatuksella koulussa että yksilöllisemmin kuten lapsen ja vanhemman kahdenkeskisillä keskusteluilla. Aikuisten on tärkeää pohtia sosiaalisen median etuja, haasteita ja mahdollisuuksia sekä omaa nettikäyttäytymistään ollakseen valmiita keskustelemaan näistä myös nuorten kanssa. Keskeistä on myös välittää nuorille ajatus siitä, että somen ahdistavista sisällöistä tai yhteydenotoista on aina kannattavaa kertoa jollekin luotettavalle aikuiselle.\n\n### Milloin somettaminen huolettaa ja mistä voi saada apua?\n\nNuorten runsas ajankäyttö somessa ja pelatessa voi olla tapa rentoutua ja pitää yhteyttä ikätovereihin, ja se saattaa vähentyä itsestään elämäntilanteen muuttuessa ja sitä vaatiessa. Tutkimukset määrittelevät somen ja netin käytön ongelmalliseksi silloin, kun se vie niin paljon huomiota, että muu hyvinvointi kuten koulunkäynti, ihmissuhteet, uni ja mieliala tulevat laiminlyödyiksi.

Pelillisessä sovelluksessa nuori voi tarkastella omaa elämäänsä ja vahvuuksiaan. Maksuton sovellus löytyy Google Playsta ja App Storesta, eikä sen käyttö edellytä rekisteröitymistä.\n\nSovellus on laadittu osaksi myöhemmin julkaistavaa yläkouluikäisten IdiXii-vertaisryhmämenetelmää, mutta se toimii myös täysin itsenäisenä omana kokonaisuutenaan. Sitä voi hyödyntää monipuolisesti esimerkiksi nuori itsekseen, kaverin tai aikuisen kanssa taikka nuorten pienemmissä tai suuremmissa ryhmissä, kuten koululuokassa. IdiXii on kehitetty tukemaan itsetuntemusta, omia vahvuuksia ja tulevaisuuden haaveita. Suunnittelussa on ollut mukana eri-ikäisiä nuoria, ja heiltä tulleet IdiXet on saatu matkalle mukaan.\n\n## Teemat\n\nIdiXiissä pelaaja kulkee tähtikartastolla etsimässä ja löytämässä vastauksia elämän tärkeisiin asioihin. Sovelluksen minipelit liittyvät nuoren oman elämän eri aihealueisiin, joita ovat:\n\nMinipelien vastauksia on mahdollista käydä tarkastelemassa ja muokkaamassa jälkikäteen.

Sovelluksen vahvuuksien tunnistamisen ja tallentamisen toimintoa voi kuitenkin hyödyntää myös pelaamatta minipelejä. Vahvuuksien tunnistaminen on paitsi mukavaa myös hyödyllistä: vahvuuksiaan käyttävät ihmiset ovat yleensä tyytyväisempiä kuin ne, joiden vahvuudet ovat löytämättä. IdiXiissä on valmiina 150 eri vahvuutta, mutta niitä voi keksiä itse lisää.\n\nSamaan tapaan pelaamatta minipelejä toimivat myös sovelluksen rentoutus- ja tietoisuusharjoitukset, joita on yhteensä yhdeksän eli jokaisesta minipelin teemasta omansa. Rentoutus- ja tietoisuusharjoitukset ovat kuunneltavissa sovelluksesta, mutta ne ovat myös itse luettavissa teksteinä. Näin harjoituksia voi toteuttaa esimerkiksi ryhmä- tai luokkatilanteessa ohjaajan tai opettajan lukemana. Sovellukseen on tehty oma äänimaailmansa, mutta äänet saa asetuksista pois esimerkiksi luokkatyöskentelyä varten.\n\nIdiXii-sovellus Google Playssa\n\nIdiXii-sovellus App Storessa\n\nTutustu sovelluksen tietosuojaan tästä.\n\nLisätietoja sovelluksesta antaa Linkki-toiminnan vastaava asiantuntija ja ohjaaja Tiina Lamminen (tiina.lamminen@vslj.fi / 044 7355 103).\n\nJaa artikkeli:",

Perhekeskusten tarkoitus on sovittaa yhteen kuntien lasten, nuorten ja perheiden sosiaali-, terveys- ja sivistyspalveluita, hyvinvointia- ja terveyttä edistävää toimintaa sekä järjestöjen ja seurakunnan palveluita ja näistä toimijoista koostuvia verkostoja. Perhekeskukset muodostavat perheiden palveluiden kokonaisuuden.\n\nFyysisten ja verkostomaisten perhekeskuksien lisäksi myös sähköinen perhekeskus kuuluu kehittämistyön piiriin. Kehittämistyötä ohjaa kansallinen perhekeskustoimintamalli, joka varmistaa perhekeskusten rakentamista yhtenäisesti maakunnissa.\n\n## Missä mennään Varsinais-Suomessa?\n\nVarsinais-Suomessa maakunnallista perhekeskuskehittämistä tehdään Tulevaisuuden sote-keskus ohjelman alla. Alueella toimii ja on kehitteillä myös paikallisia perhekeskuksia eri kunnissa.\n\nSyksyn aikana kehittämistyö perhekeskustoimintamallin osalta on ottanut askeleita eteenpäin. On tehty kysely ja haastatteluita lapsiperheiden palveluita järjestäville tahoille sekä järjestetty kolmen työpajan sarja. Työpajoissa on käsitelty mm. perhekeskustilanteen nykykuvaa, palveluita, osaamisen jakamista sekä johtamismallia.

Selvitystyön tavoitteena on luoda perhekeskustoimintamallista konsepti Varsinais-Suomessa.\n\n## Järjestönäkökulma perhekeskuskehittämisessä\n\nVSLJ:lle ja jäsenjärjestöille on tärkeää, että järjestöjen osaaminen ja perheille suunnatut palvelut saadaan osaksi tulevia perhekeskusten rakenteita alusta alkaen. Järjestimme syksyllä maakunnallisten työpajojen rinnalla kolme jäsenjärjestöjen omaa perhekeskuskehittämisen tapaamista, joihin osallistui yhteensä 18 järjestöä. Tapaamisista koostettuja järjestöjen ajatuksia on viety suoraan maakunnallisiin työpajoihin järjestönäkökulman huomioimiseksi kehittämistyössä. Jäsenjärjestöiltä saatuja huomioita tullaan pitämään esillä myös jatkokehittämisessä.\n\n## Osaksi rakenteita\n\nTapaamisissa vahvistui ajatus siitä, että lastensuojelujärjestöt tulee ottaa mukaan hyvinvointialueen ja perhekeskusten keskeisiin toimielimiin ja strategiseen suunnitteluun. Lisäksi järjestönäkökulma tulisi näkyä keskeisissä asiakirjoissa, jotta on mahdollista kiinnittyä tuleviin rakenteisiin aidosti. Yhteistyön koordinoinnista, järjestöjen edustuksellisuudesta eri työryhmissä, sopimuksista ja rahoituskysymyksistä tulevissa rakenteissa täytyy sopia yhdessä.\n\n## Järjestöjen laaja osaaminen ja palvelut\n\nJärjestöt näkivät tärkeänä, että perhekeskuksissa n",

Niin ammatillinen työ, vapaaehtoistyö kuin kokemusasiantuntijoiden osaaminen tulee saada osaksi rakennetta. Myös kohtaamispaikoilla on merkittävä asema perhekeskuksiin liittyen, sillä niitä järjestöillä on useille kohderyhmille maakunnan alueella. Sähköisen perhekeskuksen osalta oleellisina asioina nähtiin mm. toimiva rakenne, helpot tavat päivittää tietoa ja asiakaslähtöisyys. Järjestöt näkivät myös, että palveluiden ohjaamisessa täytyy olla selkeät toimintatavat ja systeeminen työote täytyy huomioida perhekeskusten toiminnassa.\n\n## Tiedolla johtaminen ja perheiden osallisuus\n\nPerhekeskusten toimintaa arvioidessa yhteiset mittarit ovat keskeisiä. Järjestöjenkin tulisi pystyä tuottamaan tietoa palveluistaan hyvinvointialueen ja perhekeskusten raportointiin, jotta perhekeskuksia voidaan johtaa tiedolla. Lasten, nuorten ja perheiden osallisuus perhekeskuksissa on erityisen tärkeä aihe järjestöille. Järjestöt nostivatkin esiin, että perheillä tulisi olla mahdollisuus osallistua jo perhekeskusten suunnitteluvaiheeseen.\n\n## Miten kehittämistyö jatkuu?\n\nVarsinais-Suomen perhekeskustoimintamallin konseptia tullaan esittelemään 14.12.

Jotkut työyhteisöt selviytyvät työstään kunnialla, vaikka kukaan ei viesti kenenkään kanssa, kun taas toisten työyhteisöjen koko toiminta voi kaatua heikkoon vuorovaikutukseen. Kaikissa työyhteisössä vuorovaikutuksen heikkous näkyy vähintäänkin ongelmina ilmapiirissä, tiedon liikkumisessa, työssä jaksamisessa ja siinä, että osa porukasta ei saavuta (tai halua ottaa) työyhteisön täysjäsenyyttä.\n\n## Milloin vuorovaikutus alkaa?\n\nKysyttyäni, mikä vuorovaikutuksessa on ongelmana, saan usein vastaukseksi, että vuorovaikutuksen toinen osapuoli ei ymmärrä tilannetta ja sen asettamia vaatimuksia samalla tavoin kuin puhuja itse. ”Viesti ei mene perille niin kuin se on lähetetty”. Ongelman kuvaus kertoo minulle ongelman, joka ei kuitenkaan ole se, että ”viesti ei mene perille”. Se, että toinen ei näe tilannetta ja sen asettamia vaatimuksia samalla tavoin kuin toinen, on vuorovaikutuksen lähtökohta, ei sen ongelma – nyt vuorovaikutuksen pitäisi vasta alkaa. Vaatimus siitä, että toinen osapuoli hyväksyy toisen näkemyksen tämän vain ilmoittaessa sen, ja vieläpä toimii näkemyksen mukaisesti, on diktatorinen – miksi ihmeessä hänen pitäisi tehdä niin 2000-luvun suomalaisessa työyhteisössä, joka on täynnä puhetta yhdenvertaisuudesta, dialogisuudesta ja osallisu",

Kun asiakas/asukas/potilas on sitten saatu ymmärtämään oma asemansa palvelukokonaisuudessa (ja alistumaan siihen), aletaan miettiä osallistamista.\n\nYritys kontrolloida vuorovaikutusta (ja toisia ihmisiä) ei kuitenkaan kuulu hyvään vuorovaikutukseen. Hyvä vuorovaikutus ei ole sitä, että yksi saa näkemyksensä ja tavoitteensa läpi. Tällainen vuorovaikutus ei lisää yhteisymmärrystä, luottamusta, tasa-arvoa eikä osallisuutta – se lisää hierarkioita, syrjäytymistä, luottamuksen puutetta, tiedon panttaamista, manipulaatiota ja selän takana puhumista.\n\n## Vuorovaikutus on on yhteinen prosessi\n\nHyvä vuorovaikutus on prosessi, jonka etenemiseen kaikki osapuolet vaikuttavat. Jokainen hyväksyy alussa sen, että toiset katsovat asiaa omasta näkökulmastaan. Tavoitteena tulee olla omia näkemyksiä esittämällä, toisten näkemyksiä kuuntelemalla ja kaikkien näkemyksiä tutkimalla löytää yhteinen tapa ymmärtää tilanne ja toimia siinä.

Näitä taitoja ei tarvitse jokaisella työyhteisön jäsenellä olla, sillä ne voidaan sisällyttää toimintaa ohjaaviin rakenteisiin ja käytäntöihin, jotka ikään kuin pakottavat yksittäisen henkilön toimimaan dialogisella tavalla. Näin kannattaa tehdä organisaatioissa, joiden toiminnalle vuorovaikutus ja jatkuva oppiminen on tärkeää.\n\nVuorovaikutustilanne on mahdollisuus oppia ja ymmärtää lisää. Pitää vain antaa toiselle osapuolelle mahdollisuus vaikuttaa omiin näkemyksiin. Samalla toinen tuntee, että häntä kuunnellaan ja arvostetaan, mikä herättää luottamusta.

Tehdään budjetteja, muistellaan salasanoja ja suojaudutaan tietoturvauhkia vastaan. Teknologia on ohittamattomasti läsnä nykyajan organisaatioissa. Useissa järjestöissä pohditaankin, miten pysyä muutoksien matkassa mukana – ja vielä olennaisempaa: millä rahalla.\n\nOlen tavannut viimeisen kahden vuoden aikana useita kymmeniä eri kokoisten, eri aloilla ja eri puolella Suomea toimivien järjestöjen ja säätiöiden edustajia. Haasteet, huolet ja ongelmat ovat useissa organisaatioissa samat. Painokkaimmin keskusteluissa nousevat esiin kaksi asiaa: resurssien rajallisuus ja tiedonpuute.\n\n## Millä rahalla?\n\nKovin massiivisia rahakirstuja ei useasta järjestöstä löydy. Yhtenä vastauksena tähän ongelmaan on syntynyt TechSoup, joka on Suomen Nuorisoyhteistyö – Allianssi ry:n koordinoima järjestöpalvelu.

Jos kiinnostuit, voit lukea lisää klikkaamalla tästä. TechSoup ei yksinään poista ongelmaa, mutta mahdollistaa paljon sellaista, mikä ennen jäi usealla järjestöllä vain haaveeksi.\n\n## Kuka näitä osaa käyttää?\n\nTyökaluja on siis saatavilla, jopa maksutta, mikä on kiistämättä jo suuri parannus entiseen. Pelkät työkalut eivät kuitenkaan itsessään pidä järjestöjä digitalisaation kelkassa. Sen tekevät ihmiset. Työntekijät, vapaaehtoiset, kouluttajat ja johtajat. Sinä ja minä. Mitä muuta me tarvitsemme, kuin edulliset työkalut? Osaamista ja tukea niiden käyttöön.\n\nEtenkin pienissä yhdistyksissä tietoteknisen osaamisen taso riippuu yksittäisten ihmisten motivaatiosta ja taustasta. Ohjelmien käyttöönoton mahdollistaa usein yksi työntekijä tai vapaaehtoinen, joka on innostunut IT-asioista ja perehtynyt uusiin palveluihin. Osa järjestöistä ostaa IT-palveluita ulkopuolisilta kumppaneilta, jotka parhaimmillaan ymmärtävät järjestökentän tarpeita. Aina tilanne ei valitettavasti ole niin hyvä. Huonoimmillaan tilanne on se, että järjestöt eivät ole ihan varmoja mistä he tarkalleen ottaen maksavat ja kehen olla yhteydessä, jos jonkin palvelun kanssa tulee tenkkapoo.\n\nTällä hetkellä usein oppiminen tapahtuu yrityksen ja ereh",

Annetaan kaikkien äänien kuulua ja juhlitaan näitä lapsia ja nuoria sijaishuollon juhlapäivänä.\n\n## Mitä ajattelin lastensuojelusta ennen omaa kokemusta?\n\nEnnen oman lastensuojelun asiakkuuden alkua lastensuojelu pelotti minua. Ajattelin, että sosiaalityöntekijöiden ainoa työ on viedä lapset vanhemmiltaan ja sulkea lapset kurjiin olosuhteisiin lastenkoteihin. Koulussa kuulin muilta nuorilta hurjia tarinoita siitä, että mikäli ei tottele vanhempiaan niin sosiaalityöntekijät tulevat ja hakevat lastenkotiin. Minun ja kavereideni mielikuvat perustuivat siihen, mitä olimme lukeneet lastensuojelusta ja kuulleet muilta kavereilta. Nämä mielikuvat ovat yhä tänä päivänä monen mielessä totta ja väitän, että monipuolisemmalla uutisoinnilla voisimme tuoda esille, mitä lastensuojelu ja sijaishuolto todella ovat ja murtaa näitä ennakkoluuloja.\n\nRaskainta on törmätä ennakkoluuloihin yhä uudelleen ja uudelleen myös aikuisena. Kuulen paljon sitä, kuinka en näytä entiseltä sijaishuollon nuorelta tai kohtaan paljon hämmennystä siitä, kuinka voin olla korkeastikoulutettu ja silti olla kasvanut sijaishuollossa. Miltä näiden ihmisten mielestä entisen sijaishuollon nuoren sitten pitäisi näyttää? En tiedä, mutta tiedän sen, että jakamalla positiivisia kokemuksia sijaishuollosta pystymme murtamaan näitä ennakkoluuloja ja vaikuttamaan siihen, miten lastensuojelusta ajatellaan t",

Tuskin kukaan haluaa pyytää apua sellaiselta viranomaiselta, josta uutisoidaan vain negatiivisessa valossa. Voisimmeko tulevaisuudessa ajatella, että sosiaalityöntekijät ovat poliisien, lääkäreiden ja palomiehen tapaan auttajia.\n\nMinulle Care day on päivä, jolloin voin vihdoinkin juhlia omaa taustaani ja tuoda esille kaikkea sitä positiivista, mitä sijaishuoltoon liittyy ja, mitä kaikkea hyvää sijaishuollossa kasvaminen on minulle tuonut.

Historiallisessa viitekehyksessä ja globaalissa mittakaavassa lapsiamme voi pitää onnekkaina. Heillä on mahdollisuus paitsi oppia uusia asioita myös viettää aikaansa vertaistensa joukossa samalla kun hankkivat taitoja ja valmiuksia jatko-opintoihin ja lopulta työelämään. On sitä huonompiakin olosuhteita nähty, ja nähdään monessa paikassa vieläkin.\n\nMiten siis voi olla mahdollista, että maassamme on tuhansia lapsia ja nuoria, jotka eivät suostu menemään kouluun? Eivätkö he tiedä, miten onnekkaita ovat? Miten he voivat olla menemättä kouluun? Miten kouluakäymättömyydestä ja koulusta putoamisesta tuli edes vaihtoehtoja?\n\nKouluakäymättömyys johtaa vaikealle tielle. Tiedämme sen liittyvän lapsen ja nuoren heikentyneisiin oppimistuloksiin, mielenterveysongelmiin, päihteiden käyttöön ja koulukiusaamiseen. Aikuisuudessa näkyy työllistymis-, talous- ja terveysongelmia, jopa rikollisuutta.\n\nOn ihan paikallaan kysyä, mikä näitä lapsia vaivaa.\n\nTutkimuksissa on eritelty eri tason syitä sille, miksi lapsi lakkaa käymästä koulua. Yksilötasolla syyt liittyvät esimerkiksi oppimisvaikeuksiin, mielenterveys- ja muihin terveysongelmiin, neurovähemmistöön kuulumiseen, kiusaamiseen ja yksinäisyyteen.

Kritiikin kärjet kohdistuivat valinnanvapauden vaikutuksiin yli- ja alihoitoon, asiakasvalintaan, yhtiöittämisvelvollisuuteen, järjestämisen ja tuottamisen erottamisen välttämättömyyteen, uudistuksen aikataulun realistisuuteen sekä tietojärjestelmäratkaisujen toimivuuteen.

Tämän jälkeen esitys käännetään ja viilataan siihen kuntoon, että se voidaan lähettää lausuntokierrokselle. Järjestöissä, kunnissa, kuntayhtymissä ynnä muualla pähkitään lokakuun lopusta joulukuun puoliväliin saakka mitä mieltä esityksestä pitäisi olla.\n\nVuosi 2018. Eduskunta saa valinnanvapauslakiesityksen käsiteltäväkseen maaliskuussa. Lakikokonaisuus eli maakunta, sote ja siihen kytkeytyvä valinnanvapaus, vahvistetaan ja astuu voimaan kesällä. Maakuntavaalit järjestetään lokakuussa 2018, jolloin valitaan valtuutetut päättämään miten ja minne maakuntaa jatkossa ohjataan.\n\nVuosi 2019. Maakuntavaltuusto järjestäytyy vuoden alkajaisiksi, ja maakunnalle saadaan päättävä elin. Käytännössä vuosi pyhitetään sille, miten sote-järjestäminen ja valinnanvapaus aiotaan maakunnassa toteuttaa. Tämä pitää sisällään mm. sopimussiirrot maakunnille, maakuntastrategiasta päättämisen sekä talousarviovalmistelun vuodelle 2020.\n\n## Kuivakkaa – vai mitä tästä pitäisi ajatella?\n\nAikataulut menivät uusiksi, mutta muutostarve ei ole poistunut.

Rooli VSLJ:ssä?\n\nKotoa kouluun -toiminnan perhevalmentaja.\n\n2. Mikä on työssäsi parasta?\n\nAsiakkaat, eli alakouluikäiset lapset ja heidän perheensä. Ja tietenkin ihan huiput työkaverit! Työni on todella vaihtelevaa, eikä kahta samanlaista päivää ole vielä tullut vastaan. Saan tehdä yhteistyötä todella monen eri ammattilaisen kanssa ja kehittää toimintaa, joka on oikeasti vaikuttavaa.\n\n3. Lapsuuden haaveammatti?\n\nHalusin pienestä asti lastenlääkäriksi ja hainkin kirjoitusten jälkeen lääkikseen. Elämä vei ja tilalle tuli muita suunnitelmia. Valmistuin ensin lastenhoitajaksi, sen jälkeen biokemian maisteriksi ja muutaman vuoden päästä sairaanhoitajaksi. Tämän jälkeen olen vielä opiskellut itselleni ylemmän ammattikorkeakoulun tutkinnon. Viimeisimpänä (mutta tuskinpa viimeisenä) opiskelujen saralla: suoritan tällä hetkellä nepsy-valmentajan tutkintoa.\n\n4. Mitä teet mieluiten vapaa-ajalla?\n\nKudon jatkuvalla syötöllä villasukkia ”omasta päästä”. Voit käydä ihastelemassa niitä Instagramissa, löydät ne nimellä @mutsikutoo.\n\nLisäksi tykkään valokuvaamisesta – kukkia, pörriäisiä ja valon ja varjon leikkejä. Matkustellessa kuvaan aina tuhansia kuvia ja kiitän onneani, ettei kuvamäärää enää rajoita 24 tai 36 kuvan filmirulla!\n\n5. Minkä taidon haluaisit oppia?\n\nHaluaisin osata soittaa kitaraa (ja ehkä jopa laulaa).\n\n6. Minne haluaisit matkustaa?\n\nAustralia ja Uusi-S",

Minne haluaisit matkustaa?\n\nAustralia ja Uusi-Seelanti ovat aina olleet haavelistani kärjessä. Ottaisin vähintään kuukauden lomaa ja kiertelisin pitkin poikin ja valokuvaisin kaiken mihin silmä osuu 😉\n\n7. Viimeisin lukemasi kirja?\n\n”Att välja. Även i helvetet kan hoppet spira”/Edith Eger. Kirja on omaelämänkerta juutalaisen Edithin elämästä toisen maailmansodan aikana, mutta myös sen jälkeen, aina tähän päivään asti. Kirjassa kuvataan toisaalta hänen aikaansa keskitysleirillä, mutta samalla kirja on kertomus selviytymisestä ja halusta auttaa muita selviytymään. Edith on koulutukseltaan psykologi, ja on ammattinsa kautta auttanut ihmisiä löytämään avaimen henkiseen vapauteen.\n\n8. Mikä biisi saa aina hyvälle tuulelle?\n\nArtisti: Briet, biisi: Rólegur kúreki. Briet on uusi tuttavuus. Hän on islantilainen laulaja, jonka musiikkiin tutustuin Islannin matkani aikana. Hauskaa, erilaista musiikkia.\n\n9. Mitä tv-sarjaa tai elokuvaa suosittelisit?\n\nEnglantilainen sarja ”Hakekaa kätilö” on ihana ajankuvaus 50–70-luvun Englannista. ”Remontilla rahoiksi” on ehdoton reality-suosikki ja olen nähnyt kaikki 15 kautta.\n\n10. Yllättävä fakta itsestä?\n\nOlen harrastanut lapsena judoa ja aikuisena nyrkkeilyä. Olen myös harrastanut laitesukellusta.\n\nJaa artikkeli:",

Saatavuuden rajusta heikentymisestä kertoo se, että edellisessä kyselyssä (2013) 63 % vastaajista arvioi palvelun järjestyvän kohtuullisella työmäärällä ja viiveellä tai viiveettä tarpeen mukaisena, mutta nyt vastaavan arvion antoi ainoastaan 37 %. Kolmasosa vastaajista arvioi myös, että lapsia sijoitetaan usein kodin ulkopuolelle, koska tarvittu mielenterveyshoito ei ole mahdollistunut. Tästä herää myös kysymys, miten lapsen sijoittaminen ratkaisee hänen mielenterveyspalveluiden tarpeen.\n\nLasten ja nuorten mielenterveyspalvelut ja niiden saatavuus ovat toistuvasti nousseet keskusteluun viime vuosikymmenien aikana, muun muassa vuonna 2007 Jokelan koulusurman jälkeen. Aiheesta on puhuttu 1990-luvulta lähtien, mutta silti ongelmaa ei ole saatu ratkaistua ja tällä hetkellä tilanne luisuu entistä huonompaan suuntaan.

Mielenterveysongelmiin stigmaksi lyöty leima on alkanut 2000-luvulla hiljalleen haalistua ja esimerkiksi vanhemmat etsivät entistä hanakammin apua lapsilleen. Mielenterveysongelmia on luonnehdittu lasten ja nuorten kansantaudiksi, ja poliisi sekä dekkaristi Marko Kilpi kuvasi kolumnissaan Suomea hiljattain ”mielenterveysongelmien luvatuksi maaksi”. Yhä näkyvämpään ongelmaan ei pystytä vastaamaan, vaan lasten ja nuorten mielenterveyden hätään suhtaudutaan piittaamattomasti, kun yhdenvertaisuus ei toteudu.\n\n## Mielenterveyspalvelut eivät toteudu yhdenvertaisesti\n\nLapsella on oikeus mielenterveyteen. Valitettavasti tutkimukset osoittavat, että tämä oikeus ei toteudu kaikkien lasten kohdalla ja Suomen sisällä on merkittäviä alueellisia eroja, jotka asettavat lapsiperheet mielenterveyspalveluiden suhteen eriarvoiseen asemassa. Huolestuttavaa on myös se, että mielenterveyspalveluita ei löydy riittävästi peruspalveluista ja kuluvan vuoden alussa julkaistun Kelan ja THL:n raportin mukaan lapsia ohjautuukin yhä enemmän erikoissairaanhoitoon mielenterveysongelmien takia.\n\nMyös vanhempien tarvitsemien mielenterveys- ja päihdepalveluiden saatavuuden on arvioitu heikentyneen. Tämä on erittäin huolestuttavaa lapsiperheiden tilannetta ajatellen, sillä 25 % lapsista asuu perheissä, joissa vanhemmalla on hoitoa vaativat mielente",

Tämä on erittäin huolestuttavaa lapsiperheiden tilannetta ajatellen, sillä 25 % lapsista asuu perheissä, joissa vanhemmalla on hoitoa vaativat mielenterveys- ja/tai päihdeongelma. Nämä vanhemman ongelmat ennustavat vahvimmin lapsen omaa mielenterveys- ja päihdeongelmaa, jolloin ilmiöstä syntyy helposti ylisukupolvinen kierre. Kun apua ei saa, syntyy helposti kulttuuri, joka mielletään perheen ja suvun normaaliksi tavaksi olla ja elää. Näin ollen ongelmat siirtyvät tiedostamattomasti ja herkästi sukupolvelta toiselle.\n\n## Uusia avauksia ongelman ratkaisemiseksi\n\nVuonna 2015 voimaan tulleella uudella sosiaalihuoltolailla on pyrkimys oikeaan suuntaan: palveluiden painopiste pyritään siirtämään korjaavista erityispalveluista ennaltaehkäiseviin yleisiin palveluihin. Vuoden 2017 Kouluterveyskyselyn tulokset viittaavat kuitenkin siihen, että ennaltaehkäisevät palvelut ja varhainen tuki ei toteudu toivottavalla tavalla: 38 % turkulaisista 8. ja 9. -luokkalaisista ei ole saanut tukea ja apua hyvinvointiin koulupsykologilta lukuvuoden aikana, vaikka olisi halunnut. Vastaava luku koko maassa oli 31 %. Lapsen ja nuoren itsensä sekä yhteiskunnan kannalta olisi ehdottomasti parasta, että ongelmat tunnistettaisiin varhaisessa vaiheessa ja matalan kynnyksen palveluun ohjautuminen olisi helppoa. Näin myös ehkäistäisiin erikoissairaanhoidon ja kodin ulkopuolelle sijoittamisen tarve, jotka ovat kustannuksiltaan kalleimpia vaihtoehtoja.\n\nViimeaika",

Kansanedustaja Päivi Räsänen esitti hallitukselle kirjallisen kysymyksen siitä, miten se aikoo vahvistaa lasten mielenterveyshäiriöiden hoito- ja kuntoutuspalvelujärjestelmää sote-uudistuksen yhteydessä. Mielenterveyspoliittinen neuvottelukunta puolestaan esitti kannanotossaan Mieli 2.0 – uuden kansallisen mielenterveys- ja päihdeohjelman vuoteen 2025. Mieli 2.0 on ”rakenteisiin pureutuva poikkihallinnollinen ohjelma, joka kohdistuu mielenterveyteen ja päihteiden käyttöön vaikuttaviin taustatekijöihin, ehkäisee syrjäytymistä sekä muuttaa palvelujen painopistettä varhaisempaan ja ihmislähtöisempään suuntaan.” Neuvottelukunnan ehdotus pureutuu mielenterveys- ja päihdeongelmiin kokonaisvaltaisesti huomioiden alueelliset, väestöryhmälliset ja diagnoosiryhmittäiset erot. Kokonaisvaltaisen ohjelman toteutuminen edistäisi lasten ja nuorten mielenterveyttä laaja-alaisesti, sillä se toisi apua koko perheen tilanteelle.\n\nKuten neuvottelukunnan kannanotossakin todetaan, sote- ja maakuntauudistukseen sisältyy mielenterveys- ja päihdepalveluiden osalta sekä mahdollisuuksia, mutta myös uhkia.

Aika tuokioille on perjantaisin klo 20-21.30. Toivottuja aiheita ovat mm. syömishäiriöihin, raha-asioihin, ruoka-apuihin ja erilaisiin terveydellisiin ja mielenterveydellisiin haasteisiin ja näihin tarjottaviin apuihin liittyvät asiat. Paikalle toivotaan sekä ammattilaisia että myös kokemusasiantuntijoita.\n\nJos sinulla olisi tarjota aihe ja ammattilainen palveluohjaukselliseen tuokioon, ole ystävällisesti yhteydessä, kerro aiheesi ja toivomuksesi ajankohdasta: Jody Ray, Valo-Valmennusyhdistys p. 040 6748 695 jody.ray@valo-valmennus.fi\n\n## Yökahvila tarjoaa nuorille turvallisen kohtaamispaikan\n\nYökahvila on tarkoitettu 13-29-vuotiaille nuorille, s",

Yhden lapsen kanssa kävimme esim. etsimässä koulun pihalta ”turvakiven”.  Ajatuksena oli, että tarvittaessa lapsi voisi tullessa kouluun tai kesken koulupäivän mennä kertomaan kivelle asioita, jotka koulussa jännittää tai harmittaa.\n\nLapsia oli lukuvuoden aikana 24:stä eri koulusta ja kaikilta luokka-asteilta, painottuen kuitenkin 5. ja 6. luokkalaisiin. Mainittava on, että ykkösluokkalaisiakin asiakkaita oli suht runsaasti eli 13 % kaikista asiakkaista. Asiakkuuksia on vuoden mittaan alkanut ja loppunut, mutta kaiken kaikkiaan olemme työskennelleet elokuun ja toukokuun välillä 61 eri lapsen ja hänen perheensä kanssa. Tätä kirjoittaessa asiakkaita on 40. Osa näistä asiakkuuksista tulee päättymään oppilaiden siirtyessä yläkouluun, mutta monen kanssa tulemme jatkamaan heti uuden lukuvuoden alkaessa.\n\nLokakuussa käynnistyi Varhan kanssa yhteistyössä Cool Kids -ryhmä, johon osallistui 5 vanhempaa ja 4 lasta.

Kokemukset ensimmäisestä ryhmästä olivat erittäin positiiviset ja näin ollen maaliskuussa 2024 alkoi uusi 4 vanhemman ja 4 lapsen Cool Kids -ryhmä (jälleen yhteistyössä Varhan kanssa).\n\nMoniammatillisen yhteistyön voimaa olemme saaneet kokea useampaan kertaan kuluneen kouluvuoden aikana. Koulunkäynnin haasteiden kanssa painivilla lapsilla on usein laajat verkostot ympärillään ja olemmekin osallistuneet 156 eri verkostopalaveriin tämän lukuvuoden aikana. Tämän lisäksi tapasimme perheitä eri kokoonpanoissa keskimäärin 4–5 kertaa työskentelyn aikana, niin kotona kuin Perhetalo Heidekenillä. Kaiken kaikkiaan tapaamisia oli yli 200, kestoltaan yleensä 1.5–2 h. Lisäksi olemme pitäneet tiiviisti yhteyttä niin perheisiin kuin ammattilaisiin (runsaat 350 kirjattua puhelua ja/tai viestiä).\n\nLoppukeväästä olemme lähteneet tiivistämään yhteistyötä ja lisäämään ymmärrystä kouluakäymättömyydestä käsitteenä. Olemme mm. olleet vierailulla koulupsykologien ja -kuraattoreiden palavereissa, Turun perusopetuksen rehtoreiden kehittämispäivässä ja verkostoituneet varhaiskasvatuksen erityisopettajien kanssa.

Hakkeessa oli alun perin neljä pilottikuntaa (Turku, Uusikaupunki, Laitila ja Kemiönsaari), joista hanke laajeni vuonna 2021 kattamaan koko Varsinais-Suomen. VSLJ:n jäsenjärjestöjä oli mukana noin 10.\n\nPerhelinjassa kehitettiin järjestöjen keskinäistä yhteistyötä ja kuntien ja järjestöjen välistä yhteistyötä. Hankkeessa jalkautettiin järjestöjen tukea alueille seuraavien kokonaisuuksien alla: järjestöjen yksilö- ja perhetyön vastaanottotyö, ryhmämuotoinen toiminta, kaikille avoin toiminta, sekä ammattilaisille suunnattu yhteistyö mm. konsultaatio ja työparityöskentely.\n\nHankkeen aikana palveluja tuotiin lähelle perheitä niin palveluohjausbussilla kuin etäyhteyksin.

Numeroilla 113 viitattiin kolmannen sektorin hätänumeroon sote-uudistuksen myllerryksessä: hankkeen tavoitteena oli varmistaa, että järjestöt ovat mukana sote- ja maakuntavalmistelussa ja että kansalaisjärjestötoiminnan edellytykset ovat turvattuja peruskuntatasolla myös tulevaisuudessa. Hanke toteutettiin kolmen vastuujärjestön yhteistyönä. Mukana olivat Varsinais-Suomen Muistiyhdistys ry, Turun Kaupunkilähetys ry ja Varsinais-Suomen Lastensuojelujärjestöt ry.

Käytetyt nuuskapussit ja tyhjät nuuskakiekot ovat tuttu näky niin kaduilla, puistoissa kuin urheilupaikoilla. Lounais-Suomen Syöpäyhdistyksen Säkitön syyskuu -kampanjalla halutaan edistää nuorten ja heidän lähiyhteisöjensä nuuskattomuutta ja lisätä nuuskatietoutta. Syyskuisen kampanjan teemana on tänä vuonna ”Nuuska on **skaa”. Tällä halutaan tuoda esille nuuskan haitallisuutta sekä ihmisille että ympäristölle, ja myös sitä, että nuuskan käyttö on täysin turhaa. Tämän vuoden kampanjakasvoina toimivat Turun palloseuran (TPS) jääkiekkoilijat Aarne Intonen ja Eetu Liukas.\n\nkuva: Maria Kujanpää/InnoAboa\n\n## Nuuska on haitallista sekä ihmisille että ympäristölle\n\nMaahan heitetyt nuuskat ovat maatumatonta ongelmajätettä. Tupakkateollisuus kiihdyttää ilmastonmuutosta, tuhoaa metsiä, aiheuttaa metsäpaloja ja tuottaa valtavasti jätettä. Lisäksi viljelyssä käytetään suuria määriä kemiallisia lannoitteita ja torjunta-aineita, jotka muodostavat vakavan ympäristöllisen terveysongelman.\n\nNuuska on monella tavalla terveydelle haitallinen tupakkatuote. Nuuska sisältää lukuisia syöpävaarallisia ja myrkyllisiä aineita kuten nikotiinia, kadmiumia, kromia, nikkeliä, arsenikkia ja lyijyä.\n\n– Nuoren elimistö on herkkä haitallisille aineille ja sen vuoksi pitkäaikaise",

Puhuttiin sitten vertaisesta, kokemustoimijasta, -asiantuntijasta tai -kumppanista, viestimme on sama. Tätä potentiaalia tulisi hyödyntää nykyistä enemmän. Varsinais-Suomen Lastensuojelujärjestöt ry:n (VSLJ) Koettu auttaa -kampanja tuo esiin alueen lastensuojelujärjestöjen kokemustoimijoiden äänen.\n\nKokemustoimijan ja ammattilaisen välisessä työparityöskentelyssä eri näkökulmat täydentävät toisiaan. Yhteistyön avulla voidaan parantaa asiakkaan sitoutumista ja luottamusta palveluun. Kokemustoimija Saara sekä etsivä ja matalankynnyksen työntekijä Tuuli tutustuivat Turun ensi- ja turvakodin kokemustoimijakoulutuksessa, jossa Tuuli toimi kouluttajana ja Saara koulutettavana kokemustoimijana. Koulutuksen jälkeen Tuuli ja Saara ovat kokeilleet käytännössä, miten kokemustoimijan ja ammattilaisen yhteistyö voi parhaimmillaan toimia.\n\n## Kokemukset voimavaraksi\n\nSaara valmistui kokemustoimijaksi Turun ensi- ja turvakodilta vuoden 2024 lopussa.

Aina tarvitaan melko vahvakin sysäys siihen, miten normista ja arjesta pääsee eteenpäin.

Kampanja järjestää myös 14.2.2025 klo 9–10 Lasten vaalipaneelin yhdessä HS Lasten uutisten kanssa.\n\nLasten, nuorten ja perheiden tilanne Suomessa on monella mittarilla huolestuttava.

Elinkustannusten nopea nousu on jo haastanut perheiden taloutta ja lapsiperheköyhyyden ennustetaan kasvavan. Jo nyt köyhyydessä elää 123 100 lasta eli reilut 12 prosenttia lapsista.\n\nKöyhyys asettaa lapsia eriarvoiseen asemaan, vaikuttaa pitkälle elämän kulkuun ja myös periytyy herkästi.

Tavoite on olla luotettava, turvallinen ja osaava toimija.\n\nSateenkaari Koto ry on ennaltaehkäisevän perhetyön- ja varhaiskasvatuspalvelujen sekä monikulttuurisen osaamisen toteuttajana merkittävä kumppani Varsinais-Suomen alueella. Haluamme toimia lapsiperheiden yhteisöllisyyden vahvistajana ja tukea vanhempia heidän kasvatustehtävässään sekä edistää kestävän kehityksen mukaista toimintaa kaikessa toiminnassa. Vahvistamme monikulttuuristen ja maahanmuuttajataustaisten perheiden viihtymistä ja juurtumista suomalaiseen kulttuuriin ja ympäristöön.\n\n## Ketkä teillä työs",

Syömisen ja painon tarkkailulla on kuitenkin useita haittoja, joita haluamme Älä laihduta –päivänä nostaa esiin. Tässä niistä muutamia:\n\n## 6.5. Älä laihduta –päivä\n\nVietämme sunnuntaina 6.5.

Kokonaisvaltaisen hyvinvoinnin näkökulmasta laihduttaminen on koosta riippumatta yleensä kannattamatonta.\n\nMoni elää näennäisesti terveellistä elämää\n\nMoni rajoittaa terveellisyyden nimissä tarpeettomasti ruokavalintojaan tai harrastaa tarpeettoman paljon liikuntaa.

Strategia on laadittu merkittävään murrosvaiheeseen, jossa hyvinvointialue muodostetaan ja sen toimintaa lähdetään kehittämään.\n\nMurrosvaiheessa on tärkeää turvata järjestöjen toimintaedellytykset. Jotta ihmiset löytäisivät helpommin tarvitsemansa avun ja sen saanti olisi oikea-aikaista, tulisi järjestöjen toiminnan olla selkeämmin huomioitu hyvinvointialueen lapsi- ja perhepalveluiden järjestämisen kokonaisuudessa. Järjestöjen tulisi olla tärkeä osa hyvinvointialueen tehokkuuden ja vaikuttavuuden ratkaisua julkisten palveluiden rinnalla.\n\nUudessa strategiassa tähän on ajateltu päästävän sillä, että järjestöt tuottaisivat yhdessä uusia palvelumalleja sekä pilotoisivat ratkaisuja ilmiöihin. Megatrendeistä strategiaan valittiin syventyneet eriarvoisuus ja eriytyminen, joiden tulisi ohjata järjestöjen toiminnan kehittymistä. Kolmanneksi megatrendiksi valikoitui tehottomuus. Tällä viitataan tämänhetkiseen järjestelmään, jossa rahaa kuluu, mutta ongelmat eivät vähene.\n\nVSLJ:n missio pysyy edelleen samana – teemme työtä, jotta alueen jokainen lapsi voisi hyvin.\n\nTutustu uuteen strategiaan tästä.\n\n## Lastensuojelujärjestöt osaksi hyvinvointialueen rakennetta\n\nVuosi 2022 käynnistyi vauhdikkaasti yhteistyössä Mannerheimin Lastensuojeluliiton kanssa j",

Aluevaalikeskustelun teemana oli ”Lapset ja nuoret Varsinais-Suomen hyvinvointialueen strategiaan”. Lue mitä kahdeksan eri puolueen jäsenet nostivat esiin.\n\nKevään suurimpana ilonaiheena voidaan pitää sitä, että hyvinvointialue päätti avustaa järjestöjä, ja avustusten lähtökohtana on sote-järjestöjen toimintaedellytysten turvaaminen. Tämän eteen VSLJ ja Varsinais-Suomen sote-järjestöjen neuvottelukunta ovat tehneet pitkään työtä.\n\nVSLJ osallistui keväällä tiiviisti hyvinvointialueen yhdyspintojen määrittelyyn ja järjestöjen avustamisen kriteereihin kuntien ja hyvinvointialueen kesken, sekä kävi keskustelua avainhenkilöiden kanssa. Asiasta annettiin myös lausunto. Erilaisissa vaikuttajatapaamisissa viestimme, että oikea-aikainen ja riittävä apu vaatii hyvinvointialueella matriisimallia ja vahvaa tietojohtamista.\n\nKevään aikana osallistuimme perhekeskuskehittämisen alueellisiin ja valtakunnallisiin työryhmiin. Pyrkimyksenä eri työryhmissä on ollut, että järjestöjen palvelut tunnetaan ja huomioidaan hyvinvointialueen lapsi- ja perhepalveluita rakennettaessa.

Keskellä viime kevään poikkeusoloja toteutimme jäsenjärjestöillemme vuosittaisen tunnuslukukyselyn, joka on syksyn saapumisesta huolimatta edelleen ajankohtainen.\n\nTunnuslukukysely on monelle järjestölle työläs, mutta tänä vuonna kevät toi lastensuojelujärjestöille myös täysin uudenlaisia haasteita koronan muodossa. Kyselyn pohjalta tehtävä lastensuojelujärjestöjen tunnuslukuraportti on kuitenkin yksi VSLJ:n tärkeimmistä työkaluista jäsenjärjestöjen eteen tehtävässä työssä. Vuoden 2018 raportti on tuttu niin kuntakumppaneille, Heidekenin tiedekummeille kuin alueen kansanedustajillekin.\n\nVuoden 2019 lukujen raportoinnissa on VSLJ:n omien toimintojen lisäksi mukana 38 lasten, nuorten ja lapsiperheiden parissa työskentelevää jäsenjärjestöä. Näissä yhteensä 39 yhdistyksessä työskenteli viime vuonna suuri määrä ammattilaisia, kokemusasiantuntijoita ja vapaaehtoisia, joista jokainen oli moninaisessa palvelutarjonnassa tärkeä palanen. Tunnuslukukyselyyn vastaamiseen käytetty aika ei mennyt järjestöiltä keväällä hukkaan, sillä raporttia päästiin hyödyntämään jo #onneksionjoku-kampanjoinnissa ennen vuoden 2021 budjettiriihtä.\n\nTunnusluvuissa ei ole vielä päästy täydelliseen yhteismitallisuuteen järjestöjen tilastointitapojen erojen takia",

Etenkin lasten ja nuorten palvelut ovat ruuhkautuneet ja yhä useampi nuori joutuu jonottamaan pitkään hoitoon pääsyä. Diakonissalaitoksen Vamos-nuortenpalvelun Matkalla-hanke tarjoaa 16–29-vuotiaille nuorille maksutonta tukea jonotusajan tueksi. Hankkeen juuret ulottuvat Linja20 -hankkeessa havaittuun tarpeeseen tukea mielenterveyspalveluihin jonottavia nuoria.\n\nMatkalla-asiakkuus on tarkoitettu ensisijaisesti niille työn ja koulutuksen ulkopuolella oleville nuorille, jotka jonottavat mielenterveyspalveluihin, kokevat tarvitsevansa tiiviimpää tukea kuin mitä mielenterveyspalvelut pystyvät tarjoamaan sekä niille nuorille, joilla on erikoissairaanhoidon kontakti enää seurantatasolla tai tapaamiset ovat epäsäännöllisiä.\n\nToiminnan tarkoitus ei ole korvata varsinaista hoitosuhdetta tai terapiaa, vaan edistää nuoren hyvinvointia mielenterveyspalvelujen jonotusaikana. Tavoitteena on myös motivoida asiakasta jonotuksen jälkeen alkavaan erikoisairaanhoidon kontaktiin. Matkalla-hankkeen tarkoituksena on myös tarjota yksi työkalu lisää ruuhkautuvien mielenterveyspalveluiden purkamiseen.\n\n## Motivoivaa ja kannattelevaa tukea sekä yksin että ryhmässä\n\nMatkalla-toimintaa on ollut Tampereella vuodesta 2022 ja Lahdessa 202",

On arvioitu, että Suomessa ainakin noin 15 prosentilla väestöstä esiintyy tällaisia piirteitä (Juva ym. 2015), joita voi kutsua esimerkiksi neurokirjon, neuromonimuotoisuuden tai nepsy-piirteiksi. Piirteet voivat näkyä sekä voimavarana tai erityistaitoina että arkea hankaloittavina tekijöinä, kuten keskittymisvaikeuksina ja impulsiivisuutena (Juva ym. 2015; Sedgwick ym. 2019). Koska nämä piirteet vaikuttavat merkittävästi nuorten arkeen ja hyvinvointiin, on neuromoninaisuuden ymmärtäminen sekä tuen ja palvelujen kehittäminen neurokirjon nuorten tarpeita vastaaviksi tärkeä osa sote-, kasvatus- ja opetusalojen ammattilaisten työtä.\n\n## Ymmärrä ainakin nämä neurokirjon nuorista\n\nNeurokirjon nuorista ja heidän palvelutarpeistaan kuultiin Tiedosta toimeen -webinaarissa 25.3.2025.

Kiinnitä huomiota kohtaamiseen ja mahdollista osallisuus\n\nMonet neurokirjon nuoret ja heidän vanhempansa ovat kokeneet, ettei heitä ole palveluissa kuultu tai ymmärretty riittävästi. Jotta nuori voi ja haluaa vastaanottaa tukea, hänen tulee tuntea, että häneen halutaan tutustua, häntä kohdellaan myönteisesti ja häntä kuunnellaan aidosti. Ammattilaisen ei tarvitse tietää kaikkea nuoren diagnoosista, sillä tärkeintä on halu oppia, osoittaa kunnioitusta ja kohdata nuori arvostavasti. On tärkeä kiinnittää myös huomiota nuoren osallisuuteen ja sen toteutumistapoihin. Millainen osallistumisen on nuorelle mahdollinen ja toimiva, kun käsitellään häntä koskevia asioita esimerkiksi kokouksissa? Tue tarvittaessa nuorta tai harjoittele hänen kanssaan osallistumista.\n\n### 2. Kuuntele nuorta ja perhettä tukimuotojen valinnassa\n\nNeurokirjon nuoret eivät muodosta yhtenäistä ryhmää, jossa kaikilla olisi samankaltaiset tuen tarpeet. Myös jokaisen perheen tilanne on ainutlaatuinen. On tärkeää, että sekä nuori että perhe pääsevät osallistumaan tuen suunnitteluun, kehittämiseen ja arviointiin. Tuen tavoitteiden mukaisesti tulee myös harkita, missä kokoonpanossa palvelu järjestetään. Joskus yksilötuki nuorelle on",

Tutkimuksissa on tyypillisesti tarkasteltu lapsuudessa koetun köyhyyden merkitystä yksilön koulutukseen, työmarkkinaosallisuuteen ja sosiaalipalveluiden sekä -etuuksien käyttöön aikuisuudessa. Köyhyys kuitenkin kytkeytyy lasten ja nuorten hyvinvointiin ja arjen kokemuksiin jo kuluvassa ajassa. Lapsuus ja nuoruus tulisi nähdä itsessään arvokkaina elämänvaiheina eikä vain ajanjaksoina, joissa valmistaudutaan aikuisen rooliin tulevaisuudessa. Arkikokemusten tarkastelu auttaa ymmärtämään esimerkiksi lapsuuden ja nuoruuden eriarvoistavia rakenteita ja mahdollisia mekanismeja ylisukupolvisten siirtymien taustalla.\n\nLasten ja nuorten köyhyyttä tutkittiin pitkään vain aikuisten tuottaman tiedon avulla. Vähitellen yleistyivät tutkimukset, joissa aineistojen tietolähteinä ovat nimenomaan köyhyyttä kokeneet lapset ja nuoret. Vanhempien ja muiden aikuisten arviot ovat aina toisen käden tietoa, jolloin lasten ja nuorten näkemykset voivat jäädä tutkimuksissa tavoittamatta. Vanhemmat ja lapset voivat esimerkiksi painottaa elämän eri osa-alueita toisistaan poikkeavilla tavoilla, jolloin kokemukset ja näkemykset köyhyydestä eivät välttämättä ole samanlaisia.\n\nLasten ja nuorten köyhyyttä tutkittaessa on kysyttävä asiaa heiltä itseltään: millaiseksi ",

Entä miten he jäsentävät köyhyyden syitä ja seurauksia arjessaan? Arkikokemusten tutkimisessa tarvitaan monenlaisia aineistoja, kuten lapsille ja nuorille suunnattuja kyselyjä ja heidän tuottamiaan laadullisia aineistoja.

Esimerkiksi harrastusvälineiden puuttuminen ja taloudelliset rajoitteet osallistua maksulliseen vapaa-ajan toimintaan vaikeuttavat käytännössä köyhien lasten liittymistä vertaisryhmiin. Perhetausta on yhteydessä harrastamisen määrän lisäksi sen muotoon: korkeasti koulutettujen ja hyvätuloisten vanhempien lapset osallistuvat muita useammin ohjattuihin harrastuksiin. Lisäksi taloudellisesti heikossa asemassa olevien perheiden lapset ovat useammin tyytymättömiä ystäviensä määrään kuin muut.

Köyhyys lisää lasten ja nuorten toiseuden ja osattomuuden kokemuksia sekä tuntemuksia syrjään jäämisestä. Köyhien perheiden lapset myös sopeuttavat omia tarpeitaan ja toiveitaan tyytymällä vähempään.\n\nKöyhyys kytkeytyy lasten ja nuorten psykososiaaliseen hyvinvointiin, itsetuntoon ja tulevaisuuden odotuksiin. Lapsilla ja nuorilla on jokin suunnitelma tulevaisuutensa varalle sitä harvemmin, mitä köyhempiä heidän perheensä ovat. Köyhyys kaventaa tulevaisuushorisonttia. Laadulliset tutkimukset ovat antaneet viitteitä siitä, että lapset ja nuoret kokevat köyhyydellä olevan seurauksia heidän elämänsä kaikkiin osa-alueisiin – ei vain sosiaalisiin suhteisiin ja hyvinvointiin. Toisaalta on havaittu, etteivät lapset heikossa taloustilanteessa jää passiivisiksi, vaan käyttävät aktiivisesti erilaisia arjen selviytymisstrategioita.

Ilmiö on todennettu sekä Suomessa että kansainvälisesti vertailevissa tutkimuksissa. Yhteyden taustalla olevista mekanismeista tiedetään vähän, mutta esimerkiksi jatkuva taloudellinen huoli ja matalaan statukseen liittyvä stressi voivat vähentää köyhien perheiden lasten ja nuorten subjektiivista hyvinvointia.

Näiden kyselyjen avulla voidaan tarkastella, miten ja mahdollisesti miksi köyhyys kytkeytyy lasten ja nuorten erilaisiin arjen kokemuksiin.\n\nVaikka LAPKO-tutkimushanke on vasta alussa ja aineistonkeruu edessä, voidaan aikaisemman tutkimuksen pohjalta sanoa, että köyhyys kytkeytyy monin tavoin lasten ja nuorten arkeen sekä hyvinvointiin. Hankkeen puitteissa pyritäänkin tarkastelemaan ilmiötä aikaisempaa monipuolisemmin nimenomaan Suomen ja pohjoismaisen hyvinvointivaltion kontekstissa. Sosiaalityön ja Suomen historian tutkijoiden yhteistyö voi tuottaa uudenlaista tietoa siitä, mikä on lasten ja nuorten köyhyyden arkikokemuksissa samanlaista tai poikkeavaa erilaisten yhteiskunnallisten kriisien jälkeisinä aikoina 1800-luvulta nykypäivään.

Lisäksi joka neljäs ensimmäisen polven maahanmuuttajataustaisista nuorista kokee ulkopuolisuutta ja lähes joka viides yksinäisyyttä. Rekar Abdulhamed tarkastelee väitöskirjassaan maahanmuuttajataustaisten lasten ja nuorten mielenterveyttä suojaavia ja kuormittavia tekijöitä. Hän työskentelee väitöskirjatutkijana Helsingin yliopistossa ja on vieraileva tutkija Terveyden ja hyvinvoinnin laitoksella.\n\nTiedosta toimeen -webinaarin aiheena 15.10.2024 oli maahanmuuttajataustaisten lasten ja nuorten kokemukset kuulumisesta, syrjinnästä ja yksinäisyydestä. Tähän artikkeliin on koostettu webinaarin olennaisimmat kohdat lapsia ja nuoria kohtaavien ammattilaisten näkökulmasta.\n\n### 1. Lasten ja nuorten tulee saada kokea kuuluvansa ”meihin suomalaisiin”.\n\nRajavedot ja ulossulkeminen eivät ole uhka vain maahanmuuttajataustaisten lasten ja nuorten mielenterveydelle, vaan myös yhteiskuntaan kiinnittymiselle. Ne nuoret, jotka kokevat ulossulkemista, identifioituvat vahvemmin omaan etniseen ryhmään ja taustakulttuuriinsa, sekä vuorostaan heikommin valtaväestöön ja sen kulttuuriin. Rajavedot ja ulossulkeminen siis vahvistavat eriytymistä yhteiskunnassa.\n\n### 2. Lasten ja nuorten kan",

Rajavedot ja ulossulkeminen siis vahvistavat eriytymistä yhteiskunnassa.\n\n### 2. Lasten ja nuorten kanssa on hyvä keskustella heille asetetuista odotuksista.\n\nVanhemmat saattavat pitää voimakkaasti kiinni kulttuurisista odotuksista, ja lasten valtakulttuurin omaksuminen voi aiheuttaa perheessä konflikteja. Ristiriitaiset odotukset vanhempien ja koulun sekä yhteiskunnan välillä ovat kuluttavia, ja lapset voivat jäädä kokemustensa kanssa yksin kokien ”kaksoisyksinäisyyttä”. Lisäksi he saattavat tukea ja auttaa vanhempiaan muun muassa tulkin roolissa (parentifikaatio). Myös osallistuminen perheen eteen tehtävään työhön voi vaihdella (esim. lastenhoito, työskentely vanhemman yrityksessä koulupäivien jälkeen).\n\n### 3. On tärkeää suhtautua myönteisesti lasten ja nuorten omaan tapaan kuroa kulttuuriset kuilut. Kuormittuneet lapset ja nuoret tarvitsevat tässä tukea.\n\nOman taustakulttuurin ja valtakulttuurin onnistunut dynaaminen integrointi ennustaa psykososiaalista hyvinvointia. Tämä on kuitenkin kognitiivisesti vaativaa ja vaatii yksilöltä voimavaroja. Mielen kuorma voi heikentää yksilön kykyä tällaiseen kulttuurien yhteen punomiseen.\n\nOn tärkeää luoda tunnetta oman etnisen taustan arvokkuudesta myös tilanteissa, joissa yksilö haluaa etääntyä kodin kielteisistä kokemuksista. Myönteinen etninen identiteetti suojaa rasismilta ja syrjintäkokemuksilta.\n\n## Tutkitun tiedon webinaarit ammatt",

Onhan kyseessä iso nuorten hyvinvointiin vaikuttava tekijä. Turussa syrjässä olevia nuoria on hieman alle 3000. Näistä nuorista osalta puuttuu toisen asteen koulutus. Osalla taustalla on heikko koulumenestys perusasteella, jolloin mahdollisuus tavoitella työelämään johtavaa koulutuspaikkaa on haastavaa. On nuoria, joilla on mielenterveysongelmia, nuoria, jotka ovat yksinäisiä, nuoria, joilta puuttuvat turvalliset aikuiset ympäriltä. Liian usein kohdataan myös niitä nuoria, joiden ongelmat ovat jatkuneet pitkään riittämättömän avun takia. Onneksi on myös paljon nuoria, joiden tilanteeseen voidaan vielä puuttua kevyempien tukimuotojen avulla ja joiden elämänkulun suuntaa voidaan muuttaa.\n\nTammikuun lopussa Turun kaupunginvaltuusto hyväksyi Syrjäytymisen ehkäisemisen ja sosiaalisesti kestävän kaupunkikehityksen edistämisen –toimenpideohjelman (28.1.2019, §7 ). Sen tavoitteena on edistää kaupungin asukkaiden ja ennen kaikkea nuorten hyvinvointia. Ohjelma pitää sisällään yli 70 projektia, joiden toteuttamisessa ovat mukana kaikki kaupungin toimialat ja useat 3. sektorin toimijat. Mitä tällaisen ohjelman läpivienti sitten käytännössä oikein tarkoittaa? Päätavoitteemme on, että Turussa jokaisella nuorella on ",

Heillä kaikilla on aikaa pysähtyä kuuntelemaan ja auttamaan nuorta. Olla läsnä. Panostamme myös siihen, että palvelut pystyisivät saavuttamaan nuoret paremmin, ja että nuoret löytäisivät ne avun paikat, joita he kulloinkin tarvitsevat. Edistämme nuorten lähipiirissä olevien aikuisten ja ammattilaisten osaamista kohdata nuoria ja kykyä tukea ennaltaehkäisevästi heidän mielen hyvinvointiaan. Lisäksi pidämme tärkeänä, että kaikilla nuorilla on mahdollisuus osallistua ainakin yhteen harrastukseen joka viikko ja saada sellainen koulutus, joka avaa oven työelämään.\n\nTulevaisuuden näkeminen positiivisesti, itsensä näkeminen toteuttamassa itselleen merkityksellisiä asi-oita on yksi ihmisen perustarpeista.

Barnen var 2,5 och 5 år gamla, var just på barnhemmet, men hade inget ställe att sova följande kväll.\n\nJag sa att jag ringer tillbaka snart, måste prata med min man och barn om saken. 15 minuter senare ringde jag tillbaka och sa att förstås kan de komma till vårt.  Efter det samtalet ringde jag till min vän, som hade yngre barn än jag och frågade om hon hade kläder och kanske några leksaker att låna för en månad. Ett par timmar senare kom jag hem med två plastpåsar av kläder och två plastpåsar med mjukisdjur och andra leksaker.\n\n## Vi pratade om fosterbarn redan år 2007\n\nFörsta gången vi pratade om fosterbarn var år 2007, när vi började vår adoptionsprocess. Under första mötet gick vi igenom vilka skillnader adoption familj och fosterfamilj hade. Då redan kändes det som att vara en fosterfamilj skulle kunna vara en möjlighet. Men vi beslöt att adoptera och fick vår ljuvliga prins hem i november 2010.\n\nUnder de första åren med vår äldsta hemma, pratade vi alltid nu och då om vi skulle adoptera på nytt, men att börja processen igen kändes svårt, vi pratade också om fosterbarn, men ville vara säkra att vårt barn skulle klara av att förstå skillnaden mellan adoption och att vara en fosterfami",

Min man jobbade en kortare dag på jobbet den dagen, och for efter vår son. De for ut med hunden till skogen, så att det var bara jag hemma när klockan slog 14.00 och de två små skulle komma.\n\nEtt par minuter efter två kom det en bil till vår gård och tillsammans med familjearbetarna klättrade ut två bleka och tysta barn.\n\nJag gick fram till barnen, gick ner på deras nivå och sa hej, sa mitt namn, välkomna. Det äldre barnet höll hårt om den mindres hand, och vi gick in. Där fanns det saft och kex.

Jo, det gick bra, jag hade ju semester, och vi skulle vara hemma för det mesta, inga stora planer så det gick bra. Före första månaden var slut talade vi om slutet av året, alltså 7 månader. Och i slutet av samma år blev det tillsvidare.\n\nVid varje fråga pratade min man och jag med vår son, som alltid sa samma sak, absolut. Fast han klagade och tyckte att de små var störande och allt annat, så fanns det aldrig någon fråga om att han inte ville att de skulle stanna.\n\nBörjan var inte lätt. Vår son reagerade starkt till det att mitt i allt fanns det två nya barn som krävde tid av HANS föräldrar och det tog tid bort från honom.

Vi har följt med hur barnet växer upp till ett skolbarn, som lär sig läsa och skriva. Hur barnet kommer hem med berättelser om nya vänner i skolan, och ett fullt hus av små 7 åriga barn som fnittrade och sprang och skrek och mest av allt hade roligt tillsammans på barnets födelsedag.\n\nVi har fått följa med det äldre barnet och sett hur hen får bättre självförtroende dag för dag. Hur barnet har vågat bli arg på oss, vågat lita på att vi inte går sönder av att hen skriker eller slår i dörrar. Hur barnet vågar säga emot sina vänner och går inte mera med på allt vad de säger. Vi har fått se barnet växa från ett litet blygt, osynligt barn, till en blivande tonårig som kommer 1,5h för sent från skolan, för hen har ”hängt” med kompisarna och till ett barn som glatt farit på halloweenfest till sin klasskompis, och varit övernatt där, utan att vara rädd över att vi försvinner eller ännu värre gör något rol",

Hur han jobbar flitigt i skolan, kämpar med sina utmaningar men ger aldrig upp.\n\nMest av allt har vi fått vara med om, hur vi alla fem har tillsammans klarat av svåra saker, har rett upp strider och osams.

Barnen har ännu kontakt med den socialarbetaren som gjorde beslutet om omhändertagandet, vilket menar att när frågor kommer, finns det någon som varit där och kan svara. Relationen med biologiska föräldrarna har varit god hela tiden, alla vill det bästa för barnen, och för det mesta är vi sams om vad som är bäst för barnen när det gäller de få sakerna vi får bestämma. Vi är även så lyckligt lottade att min man kan vara hemma med barnen, köra dem och sköta saker som kommer upp. Jag har ett superjobb, var jag trivs och var jag har en förstående chef som förstår att ibland kan det hända något som orsakar att jag lämnar allt och rusar någonstans.\n\nÄndå väntar vi mycket på jul- och sommarpauserna, för då har ingen något som måste göras, inga möten, ingenting, utan vi kan bara ta det lugnt och njuta tillsammans.\n\nOch det gör vi, för vi har den bästa familjen någonsin.\n\n-CC\n\nJaa artikkeli:",

Esittelyissä avaamme lastensuojelujärjestöjen toimintaa, kunta-ammattilaisten työtä tukevia järjestöyhteistyön mahdollisuuksia sekä lastensuojelujärjestöjen palveluiden löytämistä ja niihin ohjaamista. Esittelyt järjestetään Teamsissä, joten osallistuminen ei ole paikkasidonnaista.\n\n## Järjestö-kunta-yhteistyöllä tehokkaampaa tuen tarjoamista\n\nVarsinais-Suomessa on useita lasten, nuorten ja lapsiperheiden parissa toimivia järjestöjä, joissa työskentelee lukuisia ammattilaisia, vapaaehtoisia sekä kokemusasiantuntijoita.

Järjestöjen palvelut saattavat kuitenkin olla vieraita ja tietoa niistä tai niiden hyödyntämisestä ei välttämättä ole. Tiedon lisäämisellä sekä kuntatoimijoiden ja järjestöjen välisellä yhteistyöllä voidaan ennen kaikkea tehostaa tuen tarjoamista sitä tarvitseville.\n\nEsittelyissä saat lisätietoa järjestöjen toiminnasta sekä alueen lastensuojelujärjestöistä.

Tällöin kehittämistyö jää toisarvoiseksi, vaikka se varmasti antaisikin enemmän mitä ottaisi, jos siihen prosessiin olisi mahdollista heittäytyä, Simo pohtii.\n\n- Nämä realiteetit ovat ymmärrettäviä.

Jos toinen vanhempi olisi kertonut, että on mahdollista säilyttää suhde ja vanhemmuus lapseen, vaikka lapsi olisikin sijaisperheessä, olisin saattanut suhtautua jo tuolloin eri tavalla asioihin, Olga pohtii.\n\n## Puolueeton tulkki asiakkaan ja ammattilaisen välillä\n\nOlga näkee kokemustoimijan ja ammattilaisen avun toisiaan täydentävinä. Asiakas ja ammattilainen tulevat usein erilaisista maailmoista, mikä voi selittää väärinymmärryksiä.

Tällaisessa kohdassa kokemustoimija voisi tulla väliin puolueettomana osapuolena.\n\nOlgan kokemusten mukaan kokemustoimijoihin kohdistuu välillä vääriä oletuksia esimerkiksi siitä, että kokemustoimija jollakin tavalla ”liittoutuisi” asiakkaan kanssa.\n\n- Edellytys esimerkiksi kokemuskumppanikoulutukseen pääsemiseen on se, että omasta prosessista on riittävästi aikaa ja sitä on käsitelty. Ei tätä pystyisi tekemään, jos oma prosessi olisi vielä tulehtunut.\n\nYhteinen tavoite ammattilaisilla ja kokemustoimijoilla on se, että asiakas voisi mahdollisimman hyvin. Tavat ja lähtökohdat ovat erilaisia – ammattitieto tukee kokemuspohjaista tietoa ja toisinpäin. Olga haluaa välittää muille vanhemmille viestiä siitä, että elämä ei pääty lapsen sijoitukseen.\n\n- Haluan auttaa muita samaa kokeneita, jotta heidän polkunsa voisi olla helpompi. Ennen kaikkea haluan välittää viestiä toivosta, sillä sen ylläpitäminen on vanhemman ja perheen hyvinvoinnin kannalta ehdottoman tärkeää, Olga kiteyttää.\n\n## Lastensuojelujärjestöjen kokemusääni kuuluviin\n\nLastensuojelujärjestöjen kokemustoiminta on asiantuntijuutta erityisesti palvelujärjestelmästä, ja kokemusosaaminen tuo ammattilaisten työhön ja palveluiden kehittämiseen merkittävän resurssin.

Veturi-valmennuksia järjestetään ryhmävalmennuksina n. 1-2 vuoden välein Oulun ja Turun seuduilla. Tarvittaessa valmennusta on mahdollista toteuttaa myös yksilövalmennuksena. Tavoitteena on mahdollistaa eri näkökulmien ja kokemusten jakaminen, turvallinen ja luottamuksellinen ympäristö sekä tarvittava tuki. Veturit saavat valmennuksesta tukea omien vahvuuksien, voimavarojen ja rajojen tunnistamiseen ja oman tarinan työstämiseen sekä valmiuksia kokemusasiantuntijana toimimiseen ja nuorten tukemiseen sekä ohjaamiseen tarvittaessa muiden palvelujen ja tuen äärelle.\n\n#### Vastaava järjestö\n\nKokemuskumppanit, Perhekuntoutuskeskus Lauste\n\n#### Toiminta​\n\nKokemuskumppani on vanhempi, jolla on henkilökohtaista kokemusta lastensuojelusta asiakasvanhempana sekä motivaatiota auttaa ja tukea muita vanhempia ja perheitä.​​ Kokemuskumppanit toimivat tukena asiakasvanhemmille ja asiakkaan äänenä lastensuojelun kehittämistyössä yhdessä ammattilaisten kanssa.\n\n#### Koulutus\n\nKoulutuksen kesto n. 100 tuntia / 4-5 kuukautta.

Vuoden 2024 aikana tähän vaatimukseen lähdettiin vastaamaan VSLJ:n, jäsenjärjestöistä koostuvan kehittämisryhmän sekä Sosped Keskuksen yhteistyössä. Lopputuloksena syntyi Sosped Keskuksen rakentama Lastensuojelujärjestöjen ARVO -työkalu.\n\nARVO on kehitetty tukemaan VSLJ:n ja sen jäsenjärjestöjen vaikuttavuuden arviointia ja yhteiskunnallisen hyödyn todentamista. Työkalu mahdollistaa lastensuojelujärjestöille toiminnan vaikutusten arvioimisen lisäksi tiedolla johdetun kehittämisen. Työkalu myös vahvistaa kykyä perustella toiminnan merkitystä päättäjille ja rahoittajille.\n\n## Miten ARVO-työkalu toimii?\n\nARVO-työkalun vaikutusten arviointi perustuu kahteen valittuun indikaattoriin: lasten ja nuorten tyytymättömyys elämään ja vanhempien kokema yksinäisyys. Tyytyväisyys on tutkimuksen mukaan merkittävä hyvinvointia vahvistava tekijä ja tyytymättömyys yhteydessä moniin negatiivisiin seurauksiin. Yksinäisyyden on todettu olevan yhteydessä moniin terveyteen ja toimeentuloon vaikuttaviin tekijöihin. Yksinäisyys voi periytyä ja vaikuttaa myös lasten hyvinvointiin.\n\nTyökaluun on rakennettu useita eri vaikutusketjuja, jotka havainnollistavat, millaisia",

Vaikutusketjuissa on tutkimukseen perustuen arvioitu todennäköisyyksiä seurauksille, jotka aiheuttavat kustannuksia yhteiskunnalle. Vaikutusten arvioinnissa hyödynnetään tutkimustiedon lisäksi väestötietoja ja rekisteriaineistoja. Seurausten aiheuttamat kustannukset on arvioitu ensisijaisesti palveluhinnastojen avulla\n\nKun seuraukset on mallinnettu, voidaan arvioida, miten erilaiset toimenpiteet vaikuttavat yhteiskunnallisesti ja taloudellisesti. Vaikutusten arviointi perustuu siihen, kuinka yleinen jokin indikaattori on järjestöjen toimintaan osallistuvien keskuudessa, ja miten yleisyys muuttuu toiminnan aikana. Esimerkiksi, jos vanhempien yksinäisyyden kokemukset vähenevät, oletetaan, että myös siihen liittyvien kielteisten seurausten todennäköisyys pienenee.\n\n## Muutoksen mittaaminen edellyttää systemaattista tiedonkeruuta\n\nKäytännössä järjestön tehtävä on siis mitata toimintaan osallistuneissa tapahtuvaa muutosta valituissa indikaattoreissa, kohderyhmän mukaan yhdessä tai molemmissa.

Keskeistä Veturointi-toiminnassa on lastensuojelun kokemustoiminta. Tammikuussa 2018 alkanut Veturien eli lastensuojelun kokemusasiantuntijoiden koulutus on nyt saatettu ansiokkaasti projektisuunnittelija Hanna Oikarisen johdolla päätökseen.\n\n## Veturit apuna lastensuojelun piirissä oleville nuorille\n\nVeturit tarjoavat niin yksilöllistä kuin ryhmämuotoista tukea. Erään Veturin sanoin, Veturointi voi olla lähes mitä vaan eikä nuoren tarvitse kertoa Veturille itsestään enempään kuin haluaa. Veturoitaviksi nuoriksi voivat hakea 15–23 vuotiaat nuoret, joilla on juuri alkamassa tai jo käynnissä oleva lastensuojelukontakti.\n\nVaikka Vetureita yhdistää lastensuojelutausta, on heillä kaikilla omanlainen tarinansa. Turun Veturit omaavat kokemusta niin avohuollosta kuin sijaishuollostakin. Moni Vetureista kokee, että lapsena he eivät saaneet tarpeeksi ääntänsä kuuluviin itseään koskevissa asioissa. Veturit uskovat, että he pystyvät esimerkiksi tukemaan nuoria vastaavanlaisissa tilanteissa tulevaisuudessa. Moni Vetureista onkin sanonut, että yhtenä syynä lähteä mukaan toimintaan oli juuri halu korjata kokemiaan epäkohtia. Myös monet Vetureista ovat kokeneet, että he olisivat nuoruudessaan hyötyneet Veturista. Veturointi-toiminta koostuukin itse tukitoiminnan ohella myös kehittämi",

Osalla Vetureista oma tausta näkyy esimerkiksi ammatinvalinnassa. 9-vuotiaana kiireellisesti huostaanotettu Veturi toimii nykyään mielenterveys- ja päihdetyöhön erikoistuneena lähihoitajana. Toinenkin Vetureistamme on hakeutunut sosiaalialalle. Hänelle on erityisen tärkeää se, että hän pääsisi tulevaisuudessa työskentelemään nuorten parissa.\n\nEräs Vetureistamme kokee lastensuojelutaustan omalla tapaa yhä tänä päivänä leimaavaksi asiaksi. Hän on pyrkinyt murtamaan ihmisten ennakkoluuloja muun muassa jakamalla omaa tarinaansa yliopistomaailmassa. Ammattien kirjo on siis Vetureidemme joukossa hyvin monipuolinen aina sähkömiehestä tilastotieteilijään saakka.\n\nVetureilla on monia erilaisia vapaa-ajan harrastuksia sekä tapoja voimaannuttaa itseään. Uusien harrastusten aloittaminen onkin oiva esimerkki siitä, mitä veturien kanssa voi esimerkiksi tehdä. Veturien joukosta löytyy esimerkiksi lenkkikaveriksi niin entisiä kilpaurheilijoita kuin sunnuntaihölkkääjiäkin. Eräs Vetureistamme viihtyy vapaa-ajallaan lemmikkikoiriensa kanssa ja hän uskoo myös lemmikkien voimaannuttavaan vaikutukseen. Toinen Vetureistamme sen sijaan saa voimaa siitä, e",

Kokouksessa hyväksyttiin järjestön ensi vuoden talousarvio ja toimintasuunnitelma sekä valittiin uudet hallituksen jäsenet.\n\nVSLJ tulee vuonna 2023 työskentelemään järjestölähtöisen auttamistyön kiinnittämiseksi osaksi hyvinvointialueen rakenteita sekä lastensuojelujärjestökentän palveluiden kokoamiseksi. Lapset ja nuoret ovat kohdanneet lyhyessä ajassa monta kriisiä - ilmastokriisin, pandemian, Ukrainan sodan ja viimeisimpänä talous- ja energiakriisin. Kaikki eivät ole yhdenvertaisessa asemassa kriisien suhteen.\n\nErityisen huolestuttavaa on mielenterveyden haasteiden lisääntyminen. Lastensuojelujärjestöjen yhteenlasketut resurssit ovat merkittäviä ja ne tulisi kohdentaa sinne missä tuen tarve on suurinta. Lastensuojelujärjestöjen onkin löydettävä uudessa hyvinvointialueen lapsi- ja perhepalveluiden rakenteessa paikkansa, jotta apu kohdentuisi mahdollisimman tehokkaasti. Toimiva yhteistyö hyvinvointialueen kanssa edellyttää huolellista yhteistyörakenteiden ja –prosessien rakentamista.\n\nSyyskokouksessa kaudelle 2023-2024 valittiin hallitukseen jäsenet erovuoroisten tilalle.

Esimerkiksi ahdistus- ja masennusoireilu on lisääntynyt viime vuosina, ja mielenterveyspalvelut ovat pahoin ruuhkautuneet. Myös muun muassa koulu-uupumus on aiempaa yleisempää, ja yhä useampi lapsi ja nuori kokee itsensä yksinäiseksi.\n\nViime vuosien kriisit ovat iskeneet erityisesti niihin, jotka olivat jo ennestään haavoittuvammassa asemassa. Tosin on myös huomioitava, että pääosa lapsista ja nuorista voi edelleen hyvin.\n\nTuoreessa hallitusohjelmassa toki tiedostetaan tarve satsauksille. Hallitus lupaa esimerkiksi turvata lainsäädännöllä lasten ja nuorten yhdenvertaisen pääsyn perustasolla lyhytpsykoterapiaan tai muihin vaikuttaviin psykososiaalisiin hoitoihin, sekä lisätä matalan kynnyksen palveluiden ja mielenterveysavun saatavuutta yhteistyössä muun muassa järjestöjen ja seurakuntien kanssa.\n\nLeikkauksia on kuitenkin luvassa myös järjestöjen toimintaan, ja näin ollen ne heikentävät lastensuojelujärjestöjen toimintakykyä nykyisestä. Järjestöt tarjoavat yksilölle monenlaista ennaltaehkäisevää ja maksutonta tukea, ja ovat siten tärkeä osa auttamisjärjestelmää. Ne mahdollistavat sen, että useampi lapsi, nuori tai lapsiperhe saa tarvitsemaansa tukea, ja lisäävät tätä kautta hyvinvointi",

Ne mahdollistavat sen, että useampi lapsi, nuori tai lapsiperhe saa tarvitsemaansa tukea, ja lisäävät tätä kautta hyvinvointia yhteiskunnassa.\n\nOivallisen esimerkin järjestöjen merkityksellisyydestä tarjoaa Varsinais-Suomen Lastensuojelujärjestöt ry (VSLJ), joka kokoaa yhteen yhteensä 41 alueen lastensuojelujärjestön osaamisen. VSLJ:n vuosittain koostaman tunnuslukuraportin mukaan näiden järjestöjen avun piirissä oli vuonna 2022 noin 79 000 yksittäistä asiakasta. Asiakaskohtaamisia oli arviolta 430 000.\n\nLähes kaikilla tunnuslukukyselyyn vastanneilla järjestöillä on ennaltaehkäisevän ja varhaisen tuen palveluita, joita voidaan pitää pahoinvoinnin ehkäisyn kannalta erittäin tärkeinä.\n\nKaiken kaikkiaan palveluita oli saatavissa kaikissa Varsinais-Suomen kunnissa, ja niitä myös tarjottiin kaikkien kuntien asukkaille. Tuen muodot olivat monipuolisia ja niitä oli saatavilla niin pienemmille lapsille kuin nuorille ja lapsiperheillekin.\n\nLastensuojelujärjestöjen yhteiskunnallinen panos on merkittävä. Suunniteltujen leikkausten edessä herää kysymys, ymmärtävätkö päättäjät järjestöjen tärkeyttä hyvinvoinnin edistäjinä? Onko leikkauksiin todella varaa nyt, kun lasten ja nuorten pahoinvointi on kasvanut?\n\nJotta pystymme vastaamaan haasteisiin ja tarjoamaan lasten, nuorten ja perheiden tarvitsemaa tukea, on järjestöjen merkitys ymmärrettävä ja leikkaukset peruttava.\n\nJoona Sormunen\n\njärjestötyöntekijä\n\nVarsinais-S",

Tavoitteena on, että osallistujat löytävät voimavaroja ja työkaluja oman hyvinvoinnin tueksi, saavat tietoa sairaudesta ja sen tuomasta elämänmuutoksesta, saavat vinkkejä arjen ja ajatusten käsittelyyn sekä kohtaavat muita samassa tilanteessa olevia.\n\nMitä kursseilla tehdään?\n\nKursseja ohjaavat terveydenhuollon ammattilaiset, kuten sosionomi, psykologi, sairaanhoitaja, fysio- ja ravitsemusterapeutti sekä syöpätauteihin erikoistuneet lääkärit. Kursseihin sisältyy muun muassa yksilö- ja ryhmäkeskusteluja, asiantuntijaluentoja sekä toiminnallisia menetelmiä.\n\nMiten yksilö-, pari- ja perhekurssit eroavat toisistaan?\n\nYksilökurssille osallistutaan yksin, parikurssille yhdessä puolison, kumppanin tai tukihenkilön kanssa ja perhekurssille yhdessä koko perheen kanssa. Osa perhekursseista on tarkoitettu perheille, joissa on syöpää sairastava aikuinen ja osa perheille, joissa on syöpää sairastava lapsi.\n\nMiten kursseille haetaan?\n\nKaikille kursseille voi hakea joko postitetta",

Tutkimusten mukaan enemmistöllä suomalaisista lapsiperheistä menee taloudellisesti hyvin, mutta toimeentulo- ja taloudenhallinnan ongelmat ovat lapsiperheissä kuitenkin yleisiä. Vuonna 2019 Suomessa 13,4 prosenttia lapsista asui pienituloisissa perheissä (Ruotsalainen 2021), ja lapsiperheet kokevat toimeentulonsa tyypillisesti keskimäärin muita kotitalouksia vaikeammaksi (Salmi 2020). Taloudelliset ongelmat, velkaantuminen, pienituloisuus ja köyhyys rasittavat siten monen perheen arkea, ja näiden aiheuttamista haasteista kärsivät niin perheen aikuiset kuin lapsetkin.\n\nToimeentulo- ja taloudenhallinnan ongelmat ilmenevät lapsiperheissä hyvin moninaisin tavoin. Ne muun muassa lisäävät vanhempien uupumusta, ahdistusta ja masennusta sekä voivat heijastua parisuhteen laatuun ja kokemuksiin vanhemmuudesta (esim. Salmi & Kestilä 2019). Taloudelliset ongelmat ja velkaantuminen ovat usein myös yhteydessä muihin elämänhallinnan ja elämäntilanteen ongelmiin, kuten päihderiippuvuuteen tai avioeroihin (esim. Blomgren ym. 2014). Perheiden toimeentulo-ongelmat saattavat lisäksi heikentää lasten ja nuorten hyvinvointia, lisätä heidän syrjäytymisriskiään sekä ylisukupolvista huono-osaisuutt",

Myös perheiden mahdollisuudet ylläpitää sosiaalista elämää tai vaikkapa lasten mahdollisuus osallistua maksullisiin harrastuksiin voi olla haastavaa.\n\n\"Taloudelliset ongelmat ja velkaantuminen ovat usein yhteydessä muihin elämänhallinnan ja elämäntilanteen ongelmiin, kuten päihderiippuvuuteen tai avioeroihin.\"\n\n## Taloussosiaalityö talousvaikeuksissa olevien lapsiperheiden tukena\n\nTaloussosiaalityö on yksi lähestymistapa, jonka avulla talousvaikeuksissa olevia lapsiperheitä voidaan tukea. Taloussosiaalityöllä tarkoitetaan sosiaalityön työorientaatiota, joka keskittyy talouteen ja toimeentuloon liittyviin kysymyksiin (Sherraden & Huang 2019). Käytännössä tämä konkretisoituu esimerkiksi ohjauksena ja neuvontana, psykososiaalisena tukena ja yhteiskunnallisena vaikuttamistyönä (Viitasalo 2019). Taloussosiaalityö ei siis merkitse pelkästään (harkinnanvaraisen) toimeentulotuen myöntämistä asiakkaille.\n\nPerheiden kohtaamia talousvaikeuksia tulisi käsitellä sosiaalityössä monestakin syystä. Tukemalla arkista elämänhallintaa, arjen sujuvuutta sekä auttamalla tietojen ja taitojen kartuttamisessa voidaan vahvistaa asiakkaiden taloudellista toimintakykyä.

Palvelujen pirstaleisuus on kuitenkin ollut auttamistyön keskeinen haaste, ja tämä pirstaleisuus näkyy myös talousvaikeuksiin tarjolla olevassa tuessa. Suomessa talous- ja velkaneuvonta sekä perheiden psykososiaalinen tuki ovat erillään toisistaan ja rahavaikeuksia käsitellään usein perheen muusta elämäntilanteesta ja tuen tarpeesta erillisenä. Sosiaalityössä on sen sijaan tyypillistä tarkastella perheiden ja yksilöiden elämäntilanteita kokonaisvaltaisesti. Tämän vuoksi sosiaalityön konteksti tarjoaa otolliset mahdollisuudet tarkastella raha-asioita merkityksellisenä osana perheen hyvinvointia ja arjessa pärjäämistä.\n\n\"Tukemalla arkista elämänhallintaa, arjen sujuvuutta sekä auttamalla tietojen ja taitojen kartuttamisessa voidaan vahvistaa asiakkaiden taloudellista toimintakykyä.\"\n\nPerheiden talousvaikeudet kytkeytyvät usein osaksi tilanteita, joita sosiaalityön asiakastyössä muutenkin kohdataan (Viitasalo 2021). Perheiden talous ja toimeentulo eivät ole muusta arjesta irrallisia asioita. Esimerkiksi vanhemman sairastuminen tai työttömäksi jääminen merkitsevät tarvetta tarkastella perheen hyvinvointia myös taloudellisesta näkökulmasta. Huomionarvoista on myös se, että talousvaikeuksien tiedetään heikentävän yksilöille ja perheille tarjottavan muun tuen, esimerkiksi psykoterapian, vaikuttavuutta (esim. Archuleta ym. 2019).

Perus- ja ihmisoikeuksien puolustaminen on sosiaalityön keskeisimpiä tehtäviä, ja työnsarkaa löytyy myös pohjoismaisesta hyvinvointivaltiostamme. Esimerkiksi Euroopan neuvoston sosiaalisten oikeuksien komitea on huomauttanut Suomea 2010-luvulla useita kertoja perusturvan riittämättömästä tasosta. (Turtiainen ym. 2021.) Sosiaalityön ammattilaisilla on työkokemukseen perustuvaa käytännön tietoa näiden rakenteiden vaikutuksista perheiden hyvinvointiin, minkä vuoksi ammattilaisilla on myös otollinen tilaisuus tuoda havaintojaan julkiseen keskusteluun.\n\n## Taloussosiaalityö lapsiperheissä -tutkimushanke vahvistaa lapsiperheiden talousosaamista\n\nTaloussosiaalityön ja taloudellisen neuvonnan tutkimuskentillä on tehty – niin kansainvälisesti kuin Suomessakin – varsin vähän kokeelliseen näyttöön perustuvaa tutkimusta aiheen tärkeydestä huolimatta (Archuleta ym. 2015; Britt ym. 2015).

Turun ja Helsingin yliopistojen yhteinen Taloussosiaalityö lapsiperheissä -hanke vastaa juuri näihin tutkimustarpeisiin.\n\nKehitämme hankkeessa uuden, suomalaiseen kontekstiin soveltuvan taloussosiaalityön interventiomallin. Tähän liittyen kartoitamme ensin sitä, minkälaisia taloussosiaalityön työskentelytapoja on kansainvälisesti kehitetty ja miten nämä työtavat edistävät lapsiperheiden taloudellista hyvinvointia. Interventiomallin kehittämistyössä on hankkeen tutkijoiden lisäksi mukana lapsiperhesosiaalityön asiakkaita, kuntien sosiaalityöntekijöitä ja -ohjaajia sekä muita alan asiantuntijoita. Näin toimien mallista on pyritty rakentamaan aidosti asiakkaiden tarpeisiin vastaava. Hankkeessa kehitetyn mallin käyttöä pilotoidaan kehittämistyön jälkeen yhteistyökuntien lapsiperhe- ja aikuissosiaalityön asiakkailla.\n\nInterventiomallin tarkoituksena on vahvistaa perheiden talousosaamista. Talousosaamisella tarkoitetaan tässä yhteydessä muutakin kuin pelkkää taloudellista tietämystä: osaaminen kattaa myös asenteiden ja käyttäytymisen tasot.

Tähän liittyen interventiomallin tavoitteena on myös vähentää perheiden taloudellista ahdistuneisuutta. Perheiden taloudellista hyvinvointia pyritään parantamaan kokonaisvaltaisesti.\n\nTutkimushankkeen tavoitteena on lisäksi tutkia sitä, miten taloussosiaalityön interventio vaikuttaa lapsiperheiden vanhempien talousosaamiseen ja taloudelliseen ahdistuneisuuteen, sekä miten interventio on mahdollista toteuttaa sosiaalityön toimintaympäristössä.

Perheystävällisyys oli jo ennen Perheystävällinen työpaikka -ohjelmaan mukaan tuloa yhdistyksessämme jaettu arvo. Käytössä olivat esimerkiksi liukuva työaika ja laaja etätyömahdollisuus. Lähtökohdat kehittämistyölle olivat hyvät. Matkan varrella eteen tuli kuitenkin myös haasteita ja uutta opittavaa.\n\nVSLJ on pieni, hieman yli kymmenen hengen organisaatio, joka jakautuu kolmeen eri toimintoon. Osa henkilöstöstä tekee asiantuntija- ja vaikuttamistyötä, osa asiakastyötä. Henkilöstössä on sekä vakituisia, osa-aikaisia, määräaikaisia että tuntityöntekijöitä. Organisaation koosta huolimatta työnkuvat ovat vaihtelevia ja toimintojen käytännöt erilaisia. Sijaistamisia oli aiemmin hankala järjestää, koska monessa asiantuntijatehtävässä toimenkuva on hyvin yksilöllinen.\n\nPerheystävällinen työpaikka -ohjelman aikana pidempien poissaolojen varalle luotiin toimintamalli helpottamaan työmäärän jakamista sekä töihin paluuta. Lisäksi yhteisesti selkeytettiin jo luotua henkilöstöhallinnon käsikirjaa. Aloitimme kokeilun ruokatauon sisällyttämisestä työaikaan, mikä lyhentää työpäivän kokonaiskestoa.\n\nVSLJ:ssä on sovittu perheystävällisille käytännöille seuranta. Es",

Aloitimme kokeilun ruokatauon sisällyttämisestä työaikaan, mikä lyhentää työpäivän kokonaiskestoa.\n\nVSLJ:ssä on sovittu perheystävällisille käytännöille seuranta. Esimerkiksi pidempien poissaolojen jälkeen tehdään toimintamallin onnistumisen arviointia. Ohjeistukset ovat tärkeä osa uusien työntekijöiden perehdytystä.\n\nKehittämistyötä ohjelman aikana tehtiin tiimeissä, koko henkilöstön yhteisissä keskusteluissa ja anonyymien kyselyiden kautta. Yhteinen keskustelu ja kaikkien pääseminen samalle viivalle koettiin hyväksi etenkin korona-ajan jälkeen. Samalla huomasimme, että itsestään selvinä pidetyt asiat eivät ole selviä kaikille. Jo perheystävällisyyden käsite tarkoittaa eri ihmisille eri asioita, ja perheystävällisyys liittyy työhyvinvointiin. Vahvasti lapsiin kytkeytyvässä organisaatiossa perhemuotojen erilaisuus ja laaja perhekäsitys oli tärkeää huomioida.\n\nMikä on riittävää kehittämistä? Mikä on riittävä määrä erilaisia ohjeistuksia? Miten koko henkilöstö saadaan sitoutumaan kehittämiseen ja ohjeistuksiin samalla tavalla? Muun muassa näitä kysymyksiä pohdimme ohjelman aikana.\n\nKehittämistyö on nimensä mukaisesti kehittämistä, minkä takia keskustelut pyörivät monesti sen ympärillä, mitä puuttuu. On kuitenkin tärkeää pysähtyä tarkastelemaan jo olemassa olevia hyviä käytäntöjä ja vahvistamaan niitä. Itsestään selvinäkin pidetyt asiat kannattaa sanoittaa ääneen; kuten, että vapaa-ajalla voi sulkea puhelimen tai työajalla vastata tarvittaessa ",

Perheystävällisyyden vahvistamisen tulee silti jatkua myös projektin jälkeen. Perheystävällisyys syntyy käytännön ohjeistusten ja seurannan lisäksi ennen kaikkea yhteisen kulttuurin luomisesta. Yksilölliset tarpeet tulee huomioida esimerkiksi erilaisin joustoin ja avoimen keskustelun kautta.

Oikealla ja asiakaslähtöisellä ohjauksella voimme tukea naisia heidän omalla koulutus- ja työllistymispolullaan sekä vahvistaa koko perheen ylisukupolvista hyvinvointia.\n\n## Palveluohjausta moninaisiin haasteisiin maahanmuuttajan arjessa\n\nMustikoiden lisäksi pop up –palveluohjausta tarjotaan kaikille maahanmuuttajille myös päiväkotien ja perhekeskusten yhteydessä. Pop up -pisteissä saa apua arjen asiointipulmiin, esimerkiksi monenlaiseen viranomaisasiointiin. Ihmisten huolet ovat moninaisia ja ne voivat liittyä esimerkiksi päivähoidon tuloselvitysten tekemiseen, lasten koulunkäynnin tukemiseen, työllistymiseen, terveydenhoitoon, opiskelupaikan etsimiseen tai asumisasioihin. Palveluohjaajat eivät ole keskittyneet vain tiettyihin asioihin, joten se voi mahdollistaa laajan ja luottamuksellisen syventymisen perheen tilanteeseen.\n\n## Oppia tunnistetun tarpeen mukaan\n\nToimintaa kuvaa slogan ”Opitaan toisiltamme – yhdessä olemme enemmän”.

Koulutiellä-kurssi tukee koululaisten vanhempia, Vanhemmuuden tuki-kurssilla käsiteltiin erilaisia vanhemmuuteen liittyviä kysymyksiä ja Marjat-hankkeen terveysneuvonnassa on puolestaan käsitelty naisten terveyttä. Voimatanssi-ryhmässä on puolestaan liikuttu vahvistaen itseilmaisua.\n\nMustikoissa on tarjolla erilaisia teemaryhmiä, työvalmennusta ja työkokeilua. Työvalmentajan tarjoama tuki sekä välittäjänä toimiminen opiskelijan, oppilaitoksen ja työantajan välillä on edellytys aiempaa varhaisempaan työelämään siirtymiseen. Mustikassa voi tunnustella kiinnostustaan eri aloille ja saada tuntumaa suomalaisesta työelämästä myös työkokeilun keinoin.\n\nMustikkaan voi tulla myös ilman selkeämpiä ammatillisia tavoitteita, juomaan vaikka kupin kahvia ja tutustumaan ihmisiin. Toimintaan ovat tervetulleita kaikki maahanmuuttajanaiset pienten lasten kanssa.\n\nLue lisää Mustikan toiminnasta ja seuraa meitä Facebookissa!\n\nSatu Husso\n\nOpetuskoti Mustikka, palvelumuotoilija\n\nSateenkaari Koto ry, puheenjohtaja\n\nJaa artikkeli:",

Rooli VSLJ:ssä?\n\nTyöskentelen Linkki-toiminnan koordinaattorina eli työnkuvaani kuuluu nuorten ja heidän perheidensä keskusteluapu, vertaisryhmien ohjaus ja toiminnan kehittäminen.\n\n2. Mikä on työssäsi parasta?\n\nIhmisten kohtaaminen ja asiakkaiden myönteiset muutokset.\n\n3. Lapsuuden haaveammatti?\n\nPienempänä haaveilin, että minusta tulisi huippu-urheilija tai liikunnanopettaja, vähän vanhempana haaveilin ainakin tutkijan ja psykoterapeutin ammateista. Minusta tuli vapaa-ajan juoksija (tai hölkkääjä), tutkijan uraa kokeilin ja psykoterapeutin sijaan olen lyhytterapeutti, mutta ehkä joskus tulevaisuudessa vielä psykoterapeuttikin.\n\n4. Mitä teet mieluiten vapaa-ajalla?\n\nVapaa-aikaani vietän mieluiten lenkkitossut jalassa metsässä, pellon pientareilla tai kaupungin kujilla koiran kanssa tai ilman. Juostessani lataan akkuja, huollan kehoa ja meiltä ja palaudun arjen kuormituksesta. Nautin luonnon kauneudesta ja rauhasta, mutta viihdyn myös kaupunkiympäristössä.\n\n5. Minkä taidon haluaisit oppia?\n\nOlisi kiva osata laulaa.\n\n6. Minne haluaisit matkustaa?\n\nOlen käynyt kerran vaellusreissulla Annapurnan vuoristossa Himalajalla, Nepalissa ja reissu oli niin ikimuistoinen, että sinne haluaisin vielä kerran elämässäni. Haaveissani on reilun kahden viikon vaellus Annapurna-circuit, jonka varrella on ehkä upeimmat vuoristomaisemat maailmassa. Euroopan kaupungeista Ateena",

Euroopan kaupungeista Ateena ja Rooma ovat vielä näkemättä ja niissä haluaisin kyllä myös käydä.\n\n7. Viimeisin lukemasi kirja?\n\nViimeksi luin Joel Haahtelan Jaakobin portaat ja kuuntelussa on tällä hetkellä Saara Turusen Järjettömiä asioita.\n\n8. Mikä biisi saa aina hyvälle tuulelle?\n\nSodankylästä lähtöisin olevan Stepan Kaunista ja Hyvää on ihan paras hyvän mielen biisi.\n\n9. Mitä tv-sarjaa tai elokuvaa suosittelisit?\n\nElokuvista Auroraa, joka on romanttinen komedia, mutta genrelle tyypillisen hömpän ja sekoilun lisäksi elokuvassa on myös tärkeitä yhteiskunnallisia teemoja kuten nuorten syrjäytyminen, päihdeongelmat (ja niiden ylisukupolvisuus), maahanmuuttopolitiikka ja rasismi. Elokuva sijoittuu Rovaniemelle ja vanhana rovaniemeläisenä sen hahmoissa, paikoissa ja mielenmaisemassa on paljon tuttua ja tekijätiimissä useampi tuttu kaveri.\n\n10. Yllättävä fakta itsestä?\n\nMinulla on kolme perhettä. Yksi on lappilainen lapsuudenperheeni, toinen yhdessä puolisoni kassa perustamani perhe ja kolmas samoalaisen kyläpäällikkö Timun perhe, jonka jäseniksi minut ja puolisoni on otettu.\n\nJaa artikkeli:",

Yli kolmasosa nuorista on huolissaan mielenterveydestään. Lasten ja nuorten kehittyvän stressinsäätelyn harjoittelemisessa on olennaista vanhemmille tarjottava tuki.\n\nVuoden aikana Sote-akatemian Dialogiblogin Heidekenin tiedekummit -sarjassa on päästy lukemaan lapsiin, nuoriin ja perheisiin liittyvistä käynnissä olevista tutkimuksista sekä Turun yliopiston ja Åbo Akademin tieteentekijöiden ajankohtaisesta asiantuntijuudesta.

Taustalla on ajatus, että ehjinä pysyvät aikuiset luovat sellaisen ehjän yhteiskunnan, joka on ihmiselle hyvä.\n\nVakaa, turvallinen ja menestyvä yhteiskunta toimii aikuisten viisauden, aikuisten hyvän tahdon ja aikuisten toimintakyvyn varassa. Siksi on tärkeätä, että aikuiset eivät särkyisi kesken sen vastuun kantamisen, joka heille kuuluu.\n\nAikuisista riippuu myös, miten lasten elämä sujuu ja millaiset elämän eväät lapsi saa. Miten hänen taitonsa pääsevät kehittymään. Miten hänen perusluottamuksensa elämään ja usko omiin kykyihinsä ja innostus syntyvät ja lujittuvat.\n\nYhteiskunnallisessa keskustelussa esillä on ollut paljon kysymys mahdollisuuksien tasa-arvosta. Taustalla on havainto siitä, että lasten lähtökohdat elämässä pärjäämiselle ja menestymiselle ovat hyvin erilaiset. Tiedämme, että lähtökohtien erot tuppaavat vaikuttamaan vahvasti siihen, miten lasten ja nuorten elämässä lopulta käy.  Erot lähtökohdissa vaikuttavat jopa elämän pituuteen ja terveyseroihin, ellei mitään tehdä erojen vaikutusten torjumiseksi.\n\nKun tavoitellaan mahdollisuuksien tasa-arvoa, yritetään pienentää lähtökohdissa olevien eroavuuksien vaikutusta. Mahdollisuuksien tasa-arvo voidaan ymmärtää eri tavoin. Ihmisoikeuksien julistuksessakin todetaan: Kaikki sy",

Ihmisoikeuksien julistuksessakin todetaan: Kaikki syntyvät vapaina ja tasa-arvoisina. Vaikka näin julistetaan, julistus ei silti merkitse sitä, että tasa-arvo oikeasti toteutuisi. Tarvitaan konkreettisia toimia niin, että se potentiaali, ne mahdollisuudet, jotka kussakin syntyvässä ihmisessä itsessään on, voisivat täydesti toteutua jokaisen ihmisen kohdalla.\n\n## Edellytykset ehjään aikuisuuteen\n\nLupaus mahdollisuuksien tasa-arvosta tarkoittaa lapsen kohdalla sitä, että yhteiskunnassa tuetaan erityisesti niitä perheitä, jotka ovat kaikkein haavoittuvimmassa asemassa. Niitä perheitä, joissa aikuiset ovat syystä tai toisesta enemmän tai vähemmän särkyneitä eivätkä sen takia juuri nyt kykene antamaan lapselle riittävää tukea. Mitä enemmän mahdollisuuksien tasa-arvo oikeasti toteutuu, sitä enemmän meillä on tulevaisuudessa ehjiä aikuisia, joiden parissa lasten on hyvä kasvaa ja vahvistua.\n\nAikuisten haavoittuvuus ja särkyminen on osa inhimillistä todellisuutta. Siksi tarvitaan yhteisöjä, joissa vuoron perään kannetaan toisten kuormia. Pohjoismainen hyvinvointivaltiomalli on tällainen yhteisö, verotuksineen, lakeineen ja viranomaisineen.

Tunnesäätelyn strategiat voidaan jakaa kahteen ryhmään eli tunteiden uudelleen määrittelyyn pyrkiviin keinoihin ja tunneilmaisun tukahduttamista tavoitteleviin keinoihin.  Tunteiden uudelleen määrittely tarkoittaa sitä, että ihminen pyrkii muuttamaan ajattelutapaansa ja sitä kautta tunnettaan kokemastaan tilanteesta. Tunneilmaisun tukahduttaminen taas merkitsee sitä, että ihminen pyrkii vaikuttamaan tunnetilansa näyttäytymiseen ulospäin.\n\nTilanteen uudelleen määrittely johtaa useammin parempaan vointiin kuin tunteiden tukahduttaminen. Tämä selittyy sillä, että tunteiden tukahduttaminen on sekä fyysisesti että tiedollisesti uudelleen määrittelyä vaativampaa. Lisäksi se estää saamasta muilta ihmisiltä tukea tunteiden käsittelyyn, koska tunteita pyritään juuri heiltä piilottamaan.\n\n## Nuoren tunne-elämän erityisyys\n\nTutkimusten mukaan nuoruudessa kyky tunteiden tukahduttamiseen laskee ja kyky tilanteen uudelleen määrittelyyn säilyy ennallaan. Kun siis nuori ei kykene aiempaa paremmin uudelleen määrittelemään kokemiaan tilanteita ja tunteita, mutta hänen tunteiden tukahduttamisensa onnistuu aiempaa huonommin, on tuloksena näkyvästi kuohuvat tunnetilat.

Tämä on kuitenkin vain väliaikaista, kunnes nuori omaksuu oman aikuisemman tapansa tunteiden käsittelyyn ja säätelyyn.\n\nNuoret kokevat useammin ja voimakkaammin tunteita kuin nuoremmat lapset tai aikuiset. Tunteiden rakentava ilmaisu onkin yksi keskeisistä nuoruuden emotionaalisista ja sosiaalisista kehitystehtävistä. Sen voidaan katsoa muodostuvan kahdesta ulottuvuudesta eli tunteiden säätelystä ja tunteiden vakaudesta. Tunteiden säätelyssä on kyse tunteiden mukauttamisesta sosiaalisiin tilanteisiin osana vuorovaikutustaitoja, yhteisötaitoja sekä tunnetaitoja. Tunteiden vakauttamisessa taas on kyse kyvystä toipua negatiivisista tilanteista ja kokemuksista sekä ilmaista omia tunteitaan muille joustavasti.\n\n## Tunnesäätelyyn sosiaalistuminen\n\nYksinkertaistaen vanhemmat ja muut ihmiset vaikuttavat nuoren kehittyviin tunnesäätelytaitoihin kolmella tavalla: reagoimalla hänen tunteiden ilmaisuihin, osallistumalla ilmapiirin luomiseen ja antamalla mallia tunteiden käsittelystä. Mikäli aikuinen pystyy vastaanottamaan nuoren tunteita, ilmapiiri on yleisesti ottaen hyväksyvä ja aikuisen omat tunteiden säätelytaidot ovat rakentavat, vahvistuu nuoren kyky tilanteiden ja tunteiden uudelleen määrittelyyn ja tunteita tukahduttavan strategian omaksuminen vähenee.\n\nTunnesosialisaatio eli ns. tunnesäätelytaitojen opettaminen tapahtuu sekä suoraan että epä",

Aikuinen voi esimerkiksi suoraan sanallisesti tai eleillä ohjata lapsen ja nuoren tunteiden tunnistamista ja ilmaisua. Toisaalta ohjausta tapahtuu myös epäsuorasti, kun aikuinen mallintaa tiedostamattaan tunteiden käsittelyä, säätelyä ja ilmaisua itselleen haastavissa tilanteissa. Lapset ja nuoret eivät siis saa vaikutteita pelkästään siitä, miten aikuiset käsittelevät tunteita suhteessa nuoren toimintaan vaan myös siitä, miten aikuiset toimivat muissa vuorovaikutussuhteissaan tai elämäntilanteissaan.\n\n## Nuoren tunnekokemuksiin reagoiminen\n\nAikuisten tavat ottaa vastaan nuorten negatiivisia tunnetiloja on jaettu tutkimuksissa viiteen ryhmään: 1. rankaisuun eli negatiivisten seurausten tuottamiseen nuorelle, 2. liioitteluun eli tunnekokemusten paisutteluun ja niille tarpeettoman ison painoarvon antamiseen, 3. sivuuttamiseen eli nuoren tunnekokemusten ohittamiseen, 4. syrjäyttämiseen eli nuoren tunteiden vähättelyyn esimerkiksi korostamalla aikuisen omia kokemuksia sekä 5. tukemiseen eli ymmärtävästi nuoreen suhtautumiseen.\n\nAikuisten negatiiviset tavat suhtautua nuoren kielteisten tunteiden ilmaisuun johtavat nuorella tyypillisimmin tunteiden piilottamiseen ja tunteiden sietämisen vaikeutumiseen.

Vastaavasti myös nuoren emotionaalinen huonovointisuus heijastuu vanhemman heikentyvään mielialaan. Lapsen ja vanhemman negatiiviseksi ajautuvaan keskinäiseen vuorovaikutussuhteeseen olisikin hyvä saada apua yhdessä, mutta tuki vain toisellekin hyödyttää usein myös molempia ja parantaa heidän välistä vuorovaikutussuhdetta.\n\nNuori ei omaksu tunnesäätelytaitojaan ainoastaan aikuisten suhtautuessa häneen, vaan myös esimerkiksi perheen sisäiset vanhempien parisuhdevaikeudet vaikuttavat nuoren hyvinvointiin yleisen ilmapiirin kautta.

Näin ollen avun hakeminen mihin tahansa perheen sisäiseen vaikeuteen, vahvistaa usein koko perheen ja kaikkien sen jäsenten yksilöllistä hyvinvointia.\n\n## Tunnetason pahoinvointi ja hyvinvointi\n\nJopa puolet nuorista kokevat jossain vaiheessa sellaisia masennuksen tai aggression oireita, jotka haittaavat heidän henkistä ja fyysistä terveyttään sekä sosiaalista, opillista tai tiedollista toimintaansa. Tutkimusten mukaan masennuksen taustalla on muita tunteita useammin pitkittynyt suru ja aggressio-oireiden taustalla pitkittynyt viha. Sen sijaan ahdistusta edeltää tavallisesti useamman käsittelemättömän tunteen rypäs, johon saattaa liittyä esimerkiksi surun ja vihan lisäksi syyllisyyttä ja pelkoa. Tunnetason pahoinvointi on tutkimusten mukaan yhteydessä käytöshäiriöihin, kiusaamiseen, päihteidenkäyttöön ja muuhun riskikäyttäytymiseen.\n\nTunnetason hyvinvoinnin kohentuessa nuoren myönteiset tunnekokemukset lisääntyvät, itsetunto vahvistuu ja nuori saa resilienssiä eli psyykkistä palautumiskykyä, joka näkyy mukautuvuutena ja sopeutumisena elämän muuttuvissa tilanteissa.

Sekä vanhemmat että ammattilaiset kuvasivat lapsissa hyväntuulisuuden palautumista, lievän oireilun vähenemistä, toiveikkuuden lisääntymistä sekä parhaimmissa tapauksissa koulunkäynti helpottui.

Samalla järjestöjen tuen tarve ei suinkaan kadonnut, vaan moni sellainenkin perhe, joka oli aiemmin pärjännyt hyvin ilman apua, hakeutui nyt ensimmäistä kertaa avun piiriin.\n\n## Korona kasvatti asiakasmääriä ja kiihdytti digiloikkaa\n\nJärjestöt selvisivät poikkeusvuodesta kuitenkin olosuhteisiin nähden hyvin ja pystyivät tukemaan apua tarvitsevia lapsia, nuoria ja perheitä myös poikkeusoloissa. Keräsimme keväällä 2021 jäsenjärjestöiltämme tietoja vuoden 2020 keskeisistä tunnusluvuista, kuten asiakasmääristä ja resursseista. Osa järjestöistä raportoi asiakasmäärien kasvaneen selvästi edellisvuoteen verrattuna. Järjestöt ottivat myös valtavan “digiloikan”, ja monet haltuun otetuista verkkotyökaluista jäävät varmasti käyttöön myös korona-ajan jälkeen.\n\nVSLJ:n ja sen 41 jäsenjärjestön tunnusluvut on nyt koottu yhteen raporttiin. Vuosittain koostettavaa tunnuslukuraporttia hyödynnetään laajalti vaikuttamistyön tukena esimerkiksi kunta- kansanedustaja- ja yliopistoyhteistyössä.

Rajoitustoimet, etätyöt ja etäkoulu ovat muuttaneet monella tapaa lapsiperheiden arkea ja vuorovaikutusta. Monet perheet ovat joutuneet kehittelemään uusia strategioita, joilla selvitä korona-arjesta sosiaalisen eristäytymisen ja sulkutoimien aikana.\n\nEnsimmäisten tutkimusten perusteella vaikuttaa siltä, että korona-aika on kohdellut monissa maissa lapsiperheitä eriarvoisesti: osassa perheistä ongelmat kasautuvat, kun taas toisissa perheissä nautitaan lisääntyneestä kotonaolosta ja perheen yhteisestä ajasta. Eniten negatiivisia vaikutuksia koronalla näyttää olleen niissä lapsiperheissä, joissa jouston mahdollisuudet arjen järjestämisessä ovat syystä tai toisesta rajallisempia tai jotka ovat olleet jo ennen koronaa muita perheitä heikommassa asemassa (esim. Smyth ym. 2020; STM 2021). On myös todennäköistä, että koronan vaikutukset näissä perheissä ovat pitkäaikaisia (Dromey ym. 2020; Erola ym. 2020).\n\n## Korona-arki uuvuttaa\n\nKorona-arki on koetellut erityisesti yksinhuoltajia (Hertz ym. 2020; Choi ym 2020; Smyth ym. 2020).

Sosten jäsenjärjestöilleen tekemän kyselyn mukaan erityisesti yksinhuoltajalle korona-arki on ollut raskasta ja sosiaalipalveluja tarvitaan kipeästi. Helsingissä karanteenirajoitukset ovat hankaloittaneet useampaa kuin joka kolmatta (37 %) yksinhuoltajaa ja lähes yhtä moni yksinhuoltaja kokee oman hyvinvointinsa heikentyneen koronan aikana (Keskinen & Hirvonen 2020).\n\nKorona-ajan aiheuttamat lomautukset, työttömyys  ja konkurssit ovat lisänneet suomalaisperheiden epävarmuutta toimeentulosta. Monessa yksinhuoltajaperheissä rahat ovat olleet tiukassa jo ennen koronaa, koska toimeentulo lepää yhden aikuisen harteilla.\n\nTaloudellisten huolien ohella arkeen on tullut uusia velvoitteita. Koronapandemia on entisestään vaikeuttanut yksinhuoltajien työn ja perhe-elämän yhdistämistä. Kanadassa ja USA:ssa kerätyn kyselyn mukaan yksinhuoltajien on vaikeampi tehdä töitä ja huolehtia tai valvoa lastensa koulunkäyntiä oppimista samanaikaisesti oman palkkatyön kanssa, kun vastuuta ei voi jakaa toisen vanhemman kanssa. Yksinhuoltajaäidit tunsivat myös olevansa väsyneitä ja stressaantuneita, koska työn ja perheen rajat ovat hämärtyneet. Palkkatyön ja perheen välisten rajojen puuttumisella oli kielteinen vaikutus hyvinvointiin ja jaksamiseen Yksi huolenaiheista liittyi siihen, että nykyisen suorituskyvyn tai tuottavuuden heikkenemisellä voi olla kielteisiä vaikutuksia työhön tai uraan pidemmällä aik",

(Hertz ym. 2020.)\n\nSamansuuntaisia havaintoja on myös Turun yliopiston sosiaalipolitiikan ja sosiaalityön oppiaineissa keväällä 2020 kerätyssä kyselyssä:\n\n”Haastavinta on, että lapseni haluaa vanhemman huomiota pitkin päivää, vaikka yritän keskittyä työtehtäviin. Tämä on ymmärrettävää (kyseessä 6-vuotias), mutta melko rasittavaa. Työhön keskittyminen on heikentynyt selvästi ja tekeminen keskeytyy jatkuvasti. Lapseni vaatii minulta nyt hiukan erilaista seuraa kuin aiemmin, sillä eskarissa leikkimisen puuttuessa hän vaatii minua leikkikaveriksi hippaan, legoleikkeihin ym. Hän ymmärtää kyllä työni tekemisen tärkeyden (olen selittänyt, että muuten äiti ei saa palkkaa, jolla maksetaan esim. ruoka ja lelut), mutta ei aina jaksa odottaa.”\n\n”Lapset eivät saa omilta opettajilta käytännössä mitään tukea. Tehtävät vain jaetaan Wilmaan ja vanhemmat vastaa toteutuksesta. Tehtävät ovat aivan liian monimutkaisia 1 luokkalaisen itse ymmärtää. Opettaja on soittanut lapselle kerran. Koska omat työt jää päivisin puolitiehen eikä minulla ole puolisoa auttamassa, teen töitä iltaisin/öisin, kun saan lapset nukkumaan.

En uskalla laittaa myöskään lapsia kouluun koska kuulun itse riskiryhmään. Ratkaisuja tai apua ei ole löytynyt. Ensimmäistä kertaa elämässäni pelkään oman mielenterveyteni puolesta.”\n\nYksinhuoltajaperheissä koronapandemian aikana haasteita on aiheuttanut erityisesti se, etteivät perheet ole voineet turvautua tavanomaiseen lähipiiriin kuten ystäviin, sukulaisiin tai isovanhempiin. Tämä on voinut lisätä niidenkin yksinhuoltajaperheiden uupumusta, jotka ennen pandemiaa selvisivät arjessaan normaalisti. Kahden aikuisen kotitaloudessa perheen sisäiset selviytymiskeinot kuten vastuun jakaminen lasten hoivasta ja yhteisten aikataulujen teko olivat keskeisiä arjesta selviytymiskeinoja sulkutoimien aikana, mutta yksinhuoltajaperheissä joudutaan selviytymään monesti yksin (Salin ym. 2020). Myös jatkuva yhdessä olo voi koetella lapsen ja vanhemman välisiä suhteita ja kiristää pinnaa.\n\n## Lapsen perhesuhteet voivat kärsiä\n\nSuomessa monien eronneiden vanhempien ja lasten arkea rytmittävät lapsen siirtymiset vanhemman kodista toiseen.

(Miettinen ym. 2020.)\n\nKoronapandemian aikaiset rajoitukset ovat vaikuttaneet myös lasten ja vanhempien tapaamisten toteutumiseen. Hallituksen linjauksen mukaisesti korona-aikana kontakteja muihin ihmisiin ja ihmisten liikkumista piti rajoittaa. Tämä aiheutti epävarmuutta ja tulkintaerimielisyyksiä lasten tapaamisista (STM 2021). Koronavirus tai poikkeustila itsessään ei ole peruste jättää noudattamatta käräjäoikeuden päätöstä tai lastenvalvojalla vahvistettua sopimusta lapsen tapaamisoikeudesta. On kuitenkin raportoitu tilanteista, joissa koronan varjolla on estetty lasta tapaamasta toista vanhempaansa (HS 11.9.2020). Näin asiasta kirjoittaa omassa aineistossamme isä:\n\n”Haasteena ollut, että lapsen äiti ei ole koronan takia sallinut lapselle tapaamissopimuksen mukaisia vierailuja luokseni toiselle paikkakunnalle. Kummassakaan kyseessä olevassa maakunnassa ei tilanne ole koronan suhteen paha verrattuna Etelä-Suomeen. Olen yrittänyt hoitaa asiaa oikeusaputoimiston ja lastenvalvojien kautta, mutta mitään ei voi tehdä. Tilanne on käsittämätön. Etävanhemman oikeus lapseensa ja lapsen oikeus etävanhempaansa on surkea ja aiheuttaa henkistä kärsimystä.”\n\nLasten tapaamisiin liittyvistä ongelmista on raportoitu erityisesti tilanteissa, joissa toinen tai mol",

        "content": "n oikeus lapseensa ja lapsen oikeus etävanhempaansa on surkea ja aiheuttaa henkistä kärsimystä.”\n\nLasten tapaamisiin liittyvistä ongelmista on raportoitu erityisesti tilanteissa, joissa toinen tai molemmat vanhemmat ovat muodostaneet uusia suhteita (Smyth ym. 2020). Monissa näissä perheissä on lapsia useista eri parisuhteista, mikä voi altistaa viruksen leviämiselle.\n\nVanhempien olisikin tärkeä miettiä, miten lapsen luonapito ja tapaamiset toteutuvat kaikkien näkökulmasta turvallisesti. Koronaan sairastumisen ja sille altistumisen liittyvät riskit on huomioitava. Mikäli mahdollista, tapaamiset pitäisi toteuttaa sovitun mukaisesti. Jos riskinä on sairastuminen, pitää sopia poikkeusjärjestelyistä. Onneksi nykypäivänä käytössä oleva teknologia mahdollistaa yhteydenpidon moninaisin keinoin, vaikka livetapaamisia ja luonapitoa ei voisikaan toteuttaa sovitun mukaisesti. Kotiläksyissä voi auttaa ja iltasadun voi lukea virtuaalisesti. Etäyhteys ei toki korvaa kasvokkaista kohtaamista ja yhdessäoloa.\n\nLasten tapaamisiin voi korona-aikana liittyä myös logistisia haasteita. Vaikka suurin osa eronneista perheistä asuu lähekkäin ja lapsen kulkeminen kahden kodin välillä sujuu pääosin hyvin (Miettinen ym. 2020), on korona-aika tuonut esille myös uudenlaisia haasteita. Julkisten kulkuvälineiden käyttöä on voitu arastella ja Uudenmaan rajojen sulun aikana tapaamisia on voinut jäädä toteutumatta.\n\n## Yksinhuoltajaperheiden tarpeet huomioitava\n\nVaikka vielä emme tiedä koronan vaikutuksia pidem",

Erola 2020). Yksinhuoltajien uupumisen ja mahdollisten lastensuojelullisten toimenpiteiden ehkäisemiseksi kuntien on tärkeä tarjota varhaiskasvatusta ja  kotipalvelua sitä tarvitseville yksinhuoltajille arjen haasteista selviytymisen helpottamiseksi. Kotipalvelun ja varhaiskasvatuksen saatavuus ei vain mahdollista äitien työssäkäyntiä, vaan tarjoaa myös lapselle turvallisen ja hänen kehitystään ja hyvinvointiaan tukevan hoitoympäristön, jos vanhemmat alkavat väsyä. Yksin ei tarvitse jaksaa enempää kuin mihin kykenee.\n\nPerheet tarvitsevat myös tukea, ohjausta ja neuvontaa tapaamisasioista sopimiseen ja yhteisvanhemmuuden toteuttamiseen uusissa ja muuttuvissa olosuhteissa.

Asiasta uutisoitaessa sain yhteydenoton Turun Bisnesseurasta, joka halusi antaa panoksensa yhteiseen hyvään. Heillä oli halukkuutta osallistua lasten ja nuorten tukemiseen keskustan alueella. Tukenasi ry:n puolesta olimme valmiit keräämään joukon yhteistyökumppaneita ja vapaaehtoisia sillä ajatuksella, että tuodaan matalla kynnyksellä aikuisia nuorten pariin. Lupasimme vastata osallistujien koulutuksesta, heidän tukemisestaan ja ohjauksestaan ”projektin” aikana.\n\n## Yhdessä tekeminen – Keitä muita tässä on mukana?\n\nTiesin, että asian ympärillä toimii jo joukko Turun kaupungilla virkatyössä olevia ihmisiä, jotka valmistelivat osaltaan jalkautuvantyön pilottia (myöhemmin Poppi-pilotiksi nimetty toiminta), joten selvittelin miten vapaaehtoistoiminnan voisi saada osaksi tätä kokonaisuutta. Olin yhteydessä myös Turun ja Kaarinan seurakuntayhtymän nuorisosihteeri Tiina Karppiseen ja sain tietää, että myös heillä on suunnitteilla jalkautuvaan tukeen liittyvää toimintaa. Todettiin, että eri toimijoiden osaamisen yhdistäminen toisi vankan pohjan organisaatiorajat ylittävälle yhteiselle työlle.\n\n## Yhteiset pelisäännöt ovat tärkeitä\n\nVaikka alkuvaiheessa vapaaehtoistoiminnan mahdollisuuksien hyödyntämistä ei ollut kokonaisuudessa huomioitu, niin asian edetess",

Yhdessä katsoimme tärkeäksi, että yhteistyö rakennetaan suunnitelmallisesti. Näin saatiin esimerkiksi työstä nousevat kokemukset raportoitua yhteismitallisesti. Yhteinen WhatsApp-ryhmä toi mahdollisuuden käydä tarvittaessa viestintää erityistilanteista. Yhteistyöllä pystyimme järjestämään jalkautumisvuorot siten, että saimme parhaan hyödyn kokeiluista.\n\n## Järjestöillä ja vapaaehtoistyöntekijöillä on paljon annettavaa yhteisiin talkoisiin\n\nEri toimijoiden välisten pelisääntöjen sopimisen jälkeen lähestyin sähköpostitse muutamia järjestöjä yhteistyöehdotuksen merkeissä. Tärkeänä lähtökohtana oli, että nopeasta aikataulusta johtuen, jalkautuvaan työhön osallistuisivat parityönä järjestöjen ammattihenkilöt ja järjestön omat koulutetut ja kokeneet vapaaehtoistyöntekijät, joille vapaaehtoistoiminnan periaatteet ovat jo selkeät.\n\nKokeiluun osallistuivat seuraavat organisaatiot/toimijat:\n\n## Suunnittelusta toteutukseen\n\nMitä kuuluu? -kokeilun päätavoitteina olivat:\n\nTyöntekijöille ja vapaaehtoisille järjestettiin Lasten ja nuorten keskus ry",

Mitä kuuluu? -kokeilu toteutui aikavälillä 25.4.-31.5.2022. Mukana kokonaisuudessa oli yhteensä 11 eri organisaatioita, 13 työntekijää ja 16 vapaaehtoistyöntekijää. Jalkautumisvuoroja yhteensä 46, joista toteutui 44. Yhden vuoron kohdalla molemmat jalkautujat olivat sairaana eikä sijaisia ollut saatavilla.\n\nKokeilun aikana työparit liikkuivat koko keskustan alueella ja kohtasivat yhteensä 412 nuorta, joiden ikäjakauma oli 8–29 vuotta. Raporttien perusteella nuoret ottivat työparit hyvin vastaan ja he olivat pääosin mielissään kysymyksestä \"Mitä kuuluu?\". Useat kysyivät myös vastavuoroisesti, mitä teille kuuluu.\n\nKeskusteluissa nuoret nostivat esille mm. vähäiset mielenterveyspalvelut ja terapiajonot. Työhön ja opiskeluun sekä vapaa-ajanviettoon liittyviä asioita. Nuoret toivoivat vielä parempaa palveluista tiedottamista. Mitä kuuluu? -kokeilun aikana työparit saivat myös mahdollisuuden ohjata nuoria palvelujen piiriin. Tällaisia ohjaamisia olivat mm. Ohjaamoon palvelujen piiriin opastamista, nuorelle soittamista seuraavana päivänä asioiden lisäselvittämistä varten tai rekrymessuille, etsivän nuorisotyöhön ja järjestön palvelujen piir",

Erityishuomiona se, että nuoret halusivat puhua myös mukavista asioista, kuten kesäloman odotuksesta ja arkipäivän asioista.\n\n## Kokemuksia toiminnasta\n\nJärjestöjen työntekijöiden ja vapaaehtoisten raporteista nousi esille, että he kokivat nuorten kohtaamisen tärkeäksi ja jalkautuva työ tuntui merkitykselliseltä. Palaute päivystysvuoroista oli positiivista ja innostunutta. Jalkautuminen koettiin myös turvalliseksi.\n\nNuoret kokivat kohtaamiset pääosin hyvinä, nuoria ohjattiin palvelujen piiriin ja mukana olleet työntekijät kokivat työn merkitykselliseksi. Näin ollen kokeilua voidaan pitää kokonaisuudessaan onnistuneena ja tarpeellisena. Kokeilusta saadut kokemukset olivat ennakko-oletusten mukaiset ja matalankynnyksen kansalaistoiminnalla, ja vapaaehtoistoiminnan mahdollisuuksia hyödyntämällä voidaan tuoda lisäarvoa jalkautuvan toiminnan kokonaisuuteen.\n\nVastuutoimijana Tukenasi ry koki yhteistyön kaikkien osapuolten kanssa mielekkäänä ja tuntui hienolta saada monien toimijoiden yhteistyö toimimaan näin ketterästi tärkeän asian puolesta.\n\nKatja Suominen\n\ntoiminnanjohtaja, Tukenasi ry\n\nJaa artikkeli:",

Tarkoituksenamme on edistää lapsen oikeuksien alueellista toteutumista sekä parantaa lastensuojelujärjestöjen toimintaedellytyksiä.

Järjestöt kokoontuivat aluksi neuvottelukuntana ja rekisteröityivät yhdistykseksi 8.10.2002. Nykyään Varsinais-Suomen Lastensuojelujärjestöt ry:ssä on 42 jäsentä.\n\n## Arvot ja eettiset periaatteemme\n\nToimintamme perustuu lapsen oikeuksien edistämiseen ja missioomme: “Jotta alueen jokainen lapsi voisi hyvin”. Toimintaamme ohjaavat myös ympäristöohjeistus sekä turvallisemman tilan periaatteet. Olemme saaneet Väestöliiton myöntämän Perheystävällinen työpaikka -tunnuksen.\n\n## Strategia ja organisaatio\n\nStrategiakaudella 2022–2026 visionamme on, että lastensuojelujärjestöt ovat tärkeä osa hyvinvointialueen tehokkuuden ja vaikuttavuuden ratkaisua.\n\nVarsinais-Suomen Lastensuojelujärjestöt ry:n hallituksen jäsenet koostuvat jäsenjärjestöjen edustajista sekä erikseen tehtävään pyydettävästä puheenjohtajasta.

Mukaan voi tulla myös, jos läheinen on menossa tai on aiemmin ollut vankilassa. Toiminta soveltuu 7-12-vuotiaille lapsille, mutta myös esikouluikäisen osallistumista voidaan yhdessä pohtia. Ryhmän järjestävät Fingerroosin säätiön toimintakeskus Panskis, Kriminaalihuollon tukisäätiön lapsi- ja läheistyö, Auralan Setlementin Sopu-työ sekä Turun kaupunki.\n\n19.-21.6.2023 järjestettävään ryhmään valitaan 3-6 lasta ja heidät haastatellaan yhdessä huoltajan kanssa ennen ryhmän alkua. Ryhmän kokoontumispaikka on Turku, mutta osallistuakseen ei tarvitse olla turkulainen. Toiminta on perheille maksutonta.\n\nVertaisryhmätoiminnan tavoitteena on antaa lapselle turvallinen tila käsitellä läheisen vankeusrangaistukseen ja sitä edeltäviin elämäntapahtumiin liittyviä kokemuksia samankaltaisia asioita kokeneiden lasten kanssa. Lapset saavat mahdollisuuden harjoitella kaikenlaisten tunteiden ilmaisemista sekä vahvistaa pärjäävyyttään erilaisten toiminnallisten menetelmien avulla. Lisäksi leikit, hauskanpito ja mahdollisuus uusien ystävyyssuhteiden solmimiseen ovat tärkeä osa ryhmää.\n\nMikäli asiakaskunnastanne löytyy perheitä, joita tämä toiminta voisi palvella, voi heille välittää tietoa ryhmästä.

Hankkeen ensimmäinen vuosi on nyt takana. Sen aikana on päästy sovittelemaan nuorten välisiä konflikteja, luotu verkostoja ja mietitty yhteistyökumppanien kanssa, millä tavoin nuorten sovitteluja voisi kehittää.\n\nKatusovittelua ei ollut Turussa tarjolla ennen NMKY:n hanketta. Tästä nuorten välisten ristiriitojen ja konfliktien selvittelyyn kehitetystä mallista on hyviä kokemuksia muualta Suomesta, etenkin pääkaupunkiseudulta. Siellä Aseman Lapset on jo pitkään tehnyt katusovittelua. Aseman Lapset myös kouluttaa katusovittelijoiksi kasvatusalan ammattilaisia, kuten NMKY:n hanketyöntekijätkin.\n\n## Katusovittelu on pysäyttämistä ja tilanteen korjaamista\n\nMitä raflaavalta kuulostava katusovittelu on? Sen juuret ovat nimensä mukaisesti katutyössä. Helsingissä katusovittelulla saatiin rauhoitettua ostoskeskus. Ilkivallasta kiinni jääneet nuoret otettiin nopeasti käsittelemään asiaa ja korvaamaan teot erikseen sovitulla tavalla, jopa omalla työllä. Viime vuosina Aseman Lapset on ajanut valtakunnallista mallia, jossa katusovittelu on osa paikallisten sovittelutoimistojen keinovalikoimaa. Riippumatta siitä, missä katusovittelija työtään tekee, tavoitteet ovat yhtäläiset: nuorten pysäyttäminen konfli",

Riippumatta siitä, missä katusovittelija työtään tekee, tavoitteet ovat yhtäläiset: nuorten pysäyttäminen konfliktitilanteessa, mahdollisuus vastuunottoon, sovintoon pääsemisen mahdollistaminen ja korjaavien toimenpiteiden miettiminen yhdessä.\n\n## Katusovittelun ensiaskeleita Turussa\n\nTurun seudulla ei vuoden aikana ole ilmennyt tarvetta mennä tekemään katusovittelua ostoskeskuksiin. Työ alkoikin ”joka paikkaan” mainostamalla ja viranomaisten kanssa neuvottelemalla. Ankkuripoliisi oli alusta lähtien kiinnostunut katusovittelusta. Poliisin tietoon tulee paljon nuorten välisiä tilanteita, jotka eivät välttämättä ole kärjistyneet rikoksiksi asti, mutta joissa ulkopuolinen puuttuminen voi auttaa. Alle 15-vuotiaat puolestaan eivät ole rikosoikeudellisesti vastuussa teoistaan, joten katusovittelu tuo heidän tilanteisiinsa uuden toimintamallin poliisin puhuttelun lisäksi. Sovittelussahan tavoitteena on nimenomaan tilanteen korjaaminen osapuolten yhteisesti sopimalla tavalla. Saman pöydän ääressä istuminen auttaa myös ymmärtämään toista osapuolta ja ottamaan omaa vastuuta konfliktista.\n\nVarsinais-Suomen sovittelutoimisto hoitaa kaikenikäisten ihmisten sovitteluja, myös lasten ja nuorten. Sovittelijoina toimivat pääosin koulutetut vapaaehtoiset.

Näin tutustuttiin puolin ja toisin eri sovittelutapoihin ja toinen toisiin. Sovitteluperiaatteet ovat molemmissa malleissa samat, toinen vain on suunnattu nimenomaan nuorten sovitteluun.\n\n## Omat jutut ja yhteistyösovittelut\n\nTurun NMKY:n katusovitteluun ohjautuu nyt alaikäisten soviteltavia juttuja sekä kouluista että poliisilta. Osa jutuista sovitellaan NMKY:llä puhtaasti katusovitteluna niin, että sovittelijoina ovat hanketyöntekijät, katusovittelijat. Osa jutuista on yhteistyösovitteluja sovittelutoimiston ja poliisin kanssa.\n\nOmat jutut tukevat koulujen kiusaamista ehkäisevää toimintaa, koska niissä selvitellään pitkittyneitä ja monimutkaistuneita kiusaamistapauksia. Useimmiten kyse on hieman epämääräisistä jutuista, joihin liittyy somekiusaamista ja jotka eivät ole mitenkään mustavalkoisia kiusaaja-kiusattu -juttuja. Monella koululla on Verso-vertaissovittelua, jossa toiset oppilaat toimivat sovittelijoina. Erona tähän katusovittelussa on täysin ulkopuolisten aikuisten sovittelijoiden tuki ja mahdollisuus toteuttaa sovittelu koulusta irrallisena.

Nämä jutut tulevat poliisilta sovittelutoimistoon katusovittelumerkinnällä. Niissä nuori saa itse sovittelussa aivan saman palvelun kuin muissakin sovittelutoimiston rikos- ja riita-asioiden sovitteluissa.

Tällöin katusovittelijalla on mahdollisuus ohjata perhettä muihin palveluihin ja kulkea nuoren rinnalla tarvittavan ajan.\n\n## Seurantaa ja palautteen keräämistä\n\nKatusovittelu toimii myös seurantaan ja arviointiin liittyvänä lisäresurssina sovittelutoimistolle.

Merkittävät vastoinkäymiset ovat yksittäisistä tekijöistä yleisimpiä mielenterveyden häiriöihin yhdistettyjä tekijöitä. Merkittävät vastoinkäymiset voivat olla yksittäisiä tapahtumia, kuten läheisen kuolema tai onnettomuus, tai pidempikestoisia, kuten vakava sairastuminen tai muu voimakas pitkittynyt kuormittava elämäntilanne. Suurin osa ihmisistä ei kuitenkaan sairastu vastoinkäymisistä, vaan tilanteisiin sopeudutaan ja useissa tapauksissa niistä jopa omaksutaan uusia positiivisia ominaisuuksia.\n\nResilienssillä viitataan kykyyn kohdata ja sietää vastoinkäymisiä sekä palautua niistä. Arkikielessä resilienssi-termiä käytetään laveasti, ja jopa tieteellisessä tutkimuksessa sen määrittely on ollut kirjavaa. Yksi selitys termin ja käsitteen kirjavalle käytölle lienee se, miten moniulotteisesta konseptista on kyse. Resilienssi on ymmärrettävissä parhaiten prosessina, jossa biologiset, psykologiset, sosiaaliset ja ekologiset tekijät ovat yhteydessä ja vuorovaikutuksessa keskenään. Resilienssi ilmenee ja käsittääkin niin yksilöllisiä kuin yhteisöllisiä tekijöitä, ulottuen aina yksilöllisistä ominaisuuksista lähiympäristöön, yhteisöihin ja koko yhteiskuntaan.\n\nPsykologi ja väitöskirjatutkija Viivi Mondolin on tutkinut väitöskirjassaan pienten lasten vanhempien piirrer",

Aihetta käsiteltiin Tiedosta toimeen -webinaarissa 6.5.2025. Tähän artikkeliin on koottu aiheen tärkeimmät kohdat ammattilaisten näkökulmasta.\n\n## Ymmärrä ainakin nämä piirreresilienssistä\n\nPiirreresilienssillä viitataan yksilön ominaisuuteen, joka auttaa toipumaan, säilyttämään ja jopa kohentamaan mielenterveyttä silloin, kun elämässä kohtaa vastoinkäymisiä. Piirreresilienssi siis auttaa navigoimaan kuormittavissa tilanteissa ja niistä eteenpäin. Yksilön piirreresilienssi voi kehittyä hyvin erilaisia reittejä. Yleisesti ajatellaan, että resilienssin kehittyminen edellyttää vastoinkäymisistä selviytymistä, joka vahvistaa resilienssiä. Myös piirreresilienssissä tämä kehityskulku lienee keskeinen. Muita keskeisiä resilienssin kehittymiseen yhdistettyjä tekijöitä ovat esimerkiksi sosiaalinen tuki sekä turvan kokemus.\n\nTutkimusten mukaan matala piirreresilienssi on systemaattisesti yhteydessä psyykkiseen oireiluun. Tämä käy ilmi myös Mondolinin väitöskirjasta, jonka yhdessä tutkimuksessa osalla vanhemmista piirreresilienssi osoitti pysyvyyttä jopa kuuden vuoden seurannassa; vanhemmilla, joilla piirreresilienssi oli matalaa tai korkeaa, piirreresilienssi pysyi samalla tasolla kuuden vuoden seurannassa.\n\nAlle on koottu ne asiat, jotka ammattilaisen tulis",

Toiminta on suunnattu 4.–6.-luokkalaisille lapsille, jotka kokevat itsensä yksinäisiksi ja ovat sivussa/riskissä jäädä sivuun luokasta ja sosiaalisista suhteista. Malli on kehitetty STEA:n rahoittamassa hankkeessa vuosina 2018–2021. Neljän lukuvuoden aikana on toteutettu neljätoista KOTA-kerhoa, joihin on osallistunut yhteensä 120 10–12-vuotiasta lasta. Osallistujista noin puolen kotikieli on ollut muu kuin suomi ja noin puolet on yksinhuoltaja-/eroperheestä. Ryhmät ovat toiminnallisia, ammattilaisten ohjaamia ja määräaikaisia (lukuvuosi) kokonaisuuksia. Sisältö rakentuu lähiluonnon ja kaveritaitojen ympärille.\n\n## Seikkailua ja myönteisiä kokemuksia ryhmään kuulumisesta\n\nKOTA-kerhotoimintaa on toteutettu yhteistyössä Turun Pansion, Jäkärlän ja Ilpoisten sekä Paimion Kriivarin alakoulujen kanssa. Lisäksi Pansiossa tehdään yhteistyötä me-talon kanssa, jonka perheohjaaja osallistuu kerhon ryhmänohjaukseen. Ryhmät kokoontuvat viikoittain ja ryhmään valitaan enintään kymmenen oppilasta.\n\nOpettajat ja oppilashuollon ammattilaiset ovat ohjanneet lapsia ryhmään mm. yksinäisyyden, heikkojen sosiaalisten taitojen, harrastamattomuuden, luokassa vetäytymisen/syrjään jäämisen sekä kotoa saatavan tuen vähäisyyden",

Vaaleissa saavat äänestää täysi-ikäiset suomen kansalaiset sekä täysi-ikäiset muun valtion kansalaiset, joiden kotikunta on ollut kyseinen kunta yhtäjaksoisesti yli kaksi vuotta ennen vaalipäivää. Varsinais-Suomen äänestysprosentti oli viime vaaleissa noin prosentin korkeampi kuin koko Suomen ja toivon mukaan äänestysvilkkaus ei tule maakunnassamme laskemaan, sillä edessä on suuria muutoksia, jotka tulevat vaikuttamaan lasten ja lapsiperheiden elämään tulevallakin vaalikaudella SOTEsta huolimatta. Ja lasten asioista päätetään nimenomaan kuntatasolla.\n\nÄäni lapselle -kampanjassa peräänkuulutetaan lapsiperheiden palveluiden merkitystä kuntien tuottavuustekijänä. Lapsista huolehtiminen laadukkailla peruspalveluilla vähentää tulevaisuuden korjaavia kustannuksia. Pitkän aikavälin investointi kannattaa taloudellisesti. Lapsuus on lyhyt aika ihmisen elämässä ja lapsuutta eletään nykyhetkessä. Tämän takia lapsilla tulee olla oikeus vaikuttaa omiin asioihinsa, osallistua ja tulla huomoiduksi päätöksenteossa. Kuulemisen myötä lapsesta kasvaa oman arvonsa tunteva aktiivinen kansalainen, joka edistää tulevaa hyvinvointia.

Turun kaupunki on mukana Lapsiystävällinen kunta -valmistelussa Suomen Unicefin kanssa ja saanee tunnustuksen vuoden 2017 lopulla. Valmisteluprosessi on käynnistetty vuonna 2014 eli prosessi on pitkä suuren kaupungin koneistossa. Kuitenkin valmisteluprosessi itsessään on tuonut mukanaan positiivisia vaikutuksia jo ennen itse tunnustuksen saamista, mistä kertoo vahvasti se, että Turun kaupungin varhaiskasvatus on ottamassa lapsivaikutusten arviointia käyttöön oma-aloitteisesti. Lisäksi aihe on poikinut pyyntöjä asian esittelyyn naapurikuntiin Suomen Unicefin Lapsiystävällinen kunta -valmistelussa vastuussa olevalle Anri Niskalalle. Tämä on erinomaisen vahva positiivinen signaali, mikä toivon mukaan tuo mukanaan uusia aloitteita lasten oikeuksien huomioimiseen kunnallisessa päätöksenteossa.\n\nSOTE-uudistus kummittelee uutisissa ja vie huomiota pois siitä tosiasiasta, että kuntiin tulee jäämään päätöksenteko liittyen lapsen arkeen ja elinympäristöön, jotka määrittelevät hyvin vahvasti lapsen hyvinvoinnin edellytyksiä.

Miessakkien toiminnan juuret ulottuvat liki 30 vuoden taa, kun sosiaalipedagogi ja psykoterapeutti Antti-Veikko Perheentupa kiinnitti huomiota miesten enemmistöön päihde-, mielenterveys- ja väkivaltatilastoissa. Myös ennenaikaisten kuolemien määrä oli suurempaa miesten keskuudessa. Syntyi ajatus vertaisuuteen perustuvista keskusteluryhmistä, Miessakeista, joiden tavoitteena on yhä tänäkin päivänä tukea miesten henkistä, psyykkistä ja sosiaalista kasvua sekä kokonaisvaltaista hyvinvointia.\n\nMiessakit kokoaa miehiä ryhmiksi ja verkostoiksi, ja tarjoaa monipuolisesti keskusteluapua ja vertaisryhmiä erilaisiin elämäntilanteisiin ja haasteisiin:\n\n- Erosta Elossa -toiminta tarjoaa neuvoa ja vertaistukea erotilanteisiin.\n- Väkivaltaa Kokeneet Miehet -toiminta auttaa henkistä tai fyysistä väkivaltaa kohdanneita miehiä.\n- Lyömätön Linja -toiminta tarjoaa apua niille miehille, jotka ovat käyttäneet väkivaltaa omia läheisiään kohtaan.\n- Vieraasta Veljeksi -toiminnassa suomalaismiehet toimivat vapaaehtoisina työelämän mentoreina maahanmuuttajamiehille.\n- MASI- toiminta ylläpitää isien toimintakykyä oman tai perheessä kohdatun masennusoireilun aikana.\n- Isyyden Tueksi -toiminnalla pyritään saattamaan nykyinen is",

Järjestön toiminta tapahtuu pääosin Helsingin, Lahden, Turun, Tampereen, Oulun ja Kuopion seuduilla, mutta verkkopalvelut mahdollistavat sen, että apua voi saada koko Suomen laajuudella. Hyöty yksilölle on merkittävä: vanhemmuuden taidot paranevat, masennusoireet vähenevät, kokonaisvaltainen toimintakyky paranee ja maahan muuttaneiden miesten sopeutuminen suomen kieleen ja työelämään helpottuvat.

Miten siirtyminen sosiaali- ja terveyspalvelut sekä pelastustoimen järjestävälle hyvinvointialueelle näkyy lasten, nuorten tai lapsiperheiden arjessa? Monella ei vielä mitenkään, mutta taustalla tapahtuu paljon, sillä uuden kokonaisuuden rakentaminen on edelleen käynnissä. Tulevaisuuden palveluihin vaikuttavia päätöksiä ja ratkaisuja tehdään nyt.\n\nVarsinais-Suomen lasten hyväksi otettiin olennainen askel Varhan aluevaltuuston vuoden ensimmäisessä kokouksessa, kun koko valtuusto asettui tukemaan aloitetta kansallisen lapsistrategian alueellisesta toimeenpanosta. Tämän päivän polarisoituneessa politiikassa puoluerajat ylittävä tuki alueen lasten hyvinvoinnin edistämiselle on merkittävää.\n\nKansallinen lapsistrategia ei tarkoita vain ylätason lupauksia, vaan se on myös valtakunnallisella tasolla yli puoluerajojen valmisteltu asiakirja siitä, miten YK:n lapsen oikeuksien sopimuksen toteutumista edistetään käytännössä yli hallituskausien. Tavoitteena on lapsi- ja perhemyönteinen, kaikkien lasten Suomi.\n\nAloitteen taustalla on täysin uudenlainen Varsinais-Suomen Lastensuojelujärjestöjen (VSLJ) vaikuttajakummitoiminta.

Yhteistyön tavoitteena on rakentaa Varsinais-Suomesta koko Suomen lapsiystävällisin hyvinvointialue. Lapsistrategia luo osaltaan mahdollisuudet tavoitteen toteutumiselle.\n\nKansallisella tasolla lapsistrategian toimeenpano tarkoittaa käytännössä muun muassa ammattilaisten kouluttamista laajasti eri teemoista liittyen esimerkiksi lapsen oikeuksiin, syrjinnän poistamiseen tai lasten suojeluun väkivallalta.\n\nLisäksi esimerkiksi kartoitetaan mielenterveystyön kehittämistarpeita ja hyviä käytäntöjä sekä luodaan toimintamalli tukemaan lasten osallistumista yhteiskunnalliseen päätöksentekoon.\n\nKansallisen lapsistrategian keskeisenä tavoitteena on vahvistaa myös lapsivaikutusten arviointia sekä lapsibudjetointia kaikilla hallinnon tasoilla. Kysymys on siis sekä uuden kehittämisestä että vanhan ja toimivan vakiinnuttamisesta.\n\nKonkreettisia toimenpiteitä tarvitaan myös alueellisesti. Varsinais-Suomessa oli vuonna 2021 lähes 84 800 alle 18-vuotiasta lasta. Tällä hetkellä kaikkien lasten oikeudet eivät toteudu.

Apua tarvitseva joutuu liian usein itse johtamaan avun tarvettaan, ja järjestelmä on monesti niin kompleksinen, että myös auttavan ammattilaisen asema on haastava.\n\nKansallisella tasolla on tunnistettu, että lapsistrategian toimeenpanon onnistuminen vaatii resursseja, osaamista sekä laaja-alaista yhteistyötä. Aidosti lapsi- ja perhemyönteinen Varsinais-Suomi edellyttääkin kaikkien sektoreiden eri toimijoiden yhteistyötä lasten hyvinvoinnin eteen.\n\nHyvinvointialue tuo mukanaan mahdollisuuden luoda uudenlaisia yhteistyörakenteita ja palvelupolkuja, joissa eri sektoreita edustavat ammattilaiset työskentelevät yhteisen tavoitteen sekä yhteisen asiakkaan eteen. Esimerkiksi VSLJ:n jäsenjärjestöt kohtaavat vuosittain kymmeniätuhansia lapsia, nuoria ja vanhempia.

Ihmiset ovat sellaisten asioiden äärellä, jotka eivät tulee vastaan muualla. On ollut hienoa huomata, että maailmat avautuvat nuorten tarinoiden avulla, Anni toteaa.\n\n## ”Toivon, että kokemustarinani herättää uusia ajatuksia ja vähentää ennakkoluuloja”\n\nKokemusasiantuntijana Fatin on jo tottunut puhuja, ja hän on kertonut tarinaansa niin ammattilaisille, nuorille kuin eläkeläisillekin.

Olemme samaa ikäluokkaa, mutta meillä voi olla hyvin erilaisia kokemuksia elämässä, Fatin toteaa.\n\nFatin pyrkii tarinallaan ennen kaikkea murtamaan ihmisten ennakkoluuloja.\n\n- Monet perustavat näkemyksensä maahanmuuttajataustaisista ihmisistä esimerkiksi uutisotsikoihin. Toivon, että kokemustarinani herättää uusia ajatuksia ja vähentää ennakkoluuloja.\n\n## Parempaa kohtaamista – parempaa auttamista\n\nSuomessa olon aikana Fatin on itse kohdannut ennakkoluuloja. Hän toivoo, että omalla tarinallaan hän pystyisi vaikuttamaan siihen, että maahanmuuttajataustaiset kohdattaisiin samanarvoisina ja ilman tiettyjä ennakkoajatuksia.\n\n- Opinto-ohjaajani sanoi minulle 9. luokalla, että en tule pääsemään lukioon. No, lopulta pääsin, ja kirjoitin suomen kielen kirjoituksista E:n, Fatin kertoo.\n\n- Moni Fatinin puheenvuoron kuullut ammattilainen on tarttunut tähän kommenteissaan. Kun tällaisia esimerkkejä tuodaan esiin, voi moni alkaa reflektoimaan omaa toimintaansa ja pohtia, että mitä minä ammattilaisena sanon nuorille siitä, mihin he pystyvät elämässään, Anni lisää.\n\nFatin toivoo, että maahanmuuttajataustaisista ymmärrettäisiin se, että he ovat usein kokeneet erilaisia asioita elämässään, j",

Vanhempien tuloköyhyys, viimesijaisen toimeentulotuen asiakkuus ja matala koulutus kytkeytyvät vahvemmin poikien kuin tyttöjen toisen asteen tutkinnon suorittamatta jättämiseen. Toisen asteen tutkinnolla tarkoitetaan peruskoulun jälkeistä ammatti- tai lukiokoulutusta. Lisäksi aikaisempi tutkimus osoittaa vanhempien ammattiaseman, tulotason ja toimeentulotuen asiakkuuden siirtyvän sukupolvelta toiselle vahvemmin miesten keskuudessa. Sosiaalinen nousu on yleisempää taloudellisesti niukoissa oloissa kasvaneille naisille kuin miehille.\n\nMahdollisuuksien tasa-arvon toteutuessa, kaikilla on perhetaustastaan riippumatta yhtäläiset mahdollisuudet menestyä niin opiskeluissa kuin työmarkkinoilla. Tällöin yksilön aikuisuuden asema määrittyy vanhempien aseman sijaan henkilökohtaisten kykyjen ja motivaatioiden mukaan. Tutkimus osoittaa, että mahdollisuuksien tasa-arvo toteutuu suomalaisessa yhteiskunnassa heikommin poikien kuin tyttöjen keskuudessa.\n\n## Miksi näin?\n\nMiksi lapsuuden perhe määrittää vahvemmin poikien kuin tyttöjen aikuisuuden asemia ja miksi mahdollisuuksien tasa-arvo toteutuu Suomessa heikommin poikien kohdalla?

Kysymyksiin ei ole tyhjentäviä vastauksia, mutta sukupuolittuneen ilmiön taustalla olevia tekijöitä voidaan hahmotella seuraavista näkökulmista.\n\nTyttöjen on havaittu olevan koulukypsiä keskimäärin poikia aikaisemmin, ja pojilla erilaiset käytös- ja kehityshäiriöt ovat tyttöjä yleisempiä. Koulumaailman vaatimukset saattavat vastata paremmin tyttöjen temperamenttipiirteitä; Tytöt reagoivat stressiin useammin sisäisesti, esimerkiksi masennuksella, kun taas poikien stressi näkyy käytöshäiriöin, mistä seuraa enemmän negatiivista palautetta koulumaailmassa. Myös opettajakunnan naisvaltaisuus saattaa vaikeuttaa poikien sopeutumista koulussa.\n\nKoulumaailma saatetaan mieltää feminiinisenä erityisesti alemmissa yhteiskuntaluokissa. Sukupuolten välisen kuilun koulumenestyksessä on havaittu kasvavan siirryttäessä ylemmistä yhteiskuntaluokista alempiin. Tämä antaisi viitteitä taustalla vaikuttavista kulttuurisista tekijöistä. Suomalaisessa yhteiskunnassa naisten työllisyysaste on perinteisesti ollut hyvin korkea. Tästä huolimatta miehen rooli saattaa olla vahvemmin sidottu työhön ja vaurauteen naisen roolin ollessa joustavampi. Tutkimuksen mukaan köyhät miehet tuntevan syvempää arvottomuutta kuin köyhät naiset. Naisilla on enemmän mahdollisuuksia ansaita arvonantoa.

Pojat voivat omaksua sukupuolirooliinsa liitetyt odotukset varhain, mikä saattaa heijastua leimautumisen kokemuksina ja alentuneena itsetuntona. Myös isän köyhyydestä kokema stressi voi heijastua vahvemmin poikiin kuin tyttäriin.\n\nPerinteisesti maskuliinisuuteen liitetään menestyksen, voiman, itsenäisyyden, kilpailukyvyn ja kontrollin kaltaisia elementtejä. Matala sosioekonominen asema voi täten olla uhka maskuliiniselle identiteetille. Reaktio tähän saattaa olla maskuliinisen roolin korostaminen, johon voi liittyä voimakas riskienotto, rikollisuus, päihteet ja näiden ohella auktoriteetti-, yhteiskunta- ja kouluvastainen kulttuuri. Pojat saattaisivat jo biologisista lähtökohdistaan johtuen tarvita enemmän tukea kotoa, mutta voimakkaat sukupuolistereotypiat saattavat vähentää poikien saaman tuen määrää suhteessa tyttöihin.\n\n## Mitä tehdä?\n\nOpintoihin liittyviin haasteisiin tulee vastata sukupuolesta riippumatta. Erityistä huomiota on kuitenkin syytä kiinnittää haavoittuneissa olosuhteissa varttuneisiin poikiin, jotka tarvitsevat vahvempaa tukea. Usein lasta koskevat ongelmat voidaan tunnistaa jo päiväkodissa ja viimeistään lapsen kouluvuosien aikana.

Ensimmäisen vuoden aikana Suomeen saapui noin 50 000 ukrainalaista, joista kolmasosa oli lapsia. Moni suomalainen koki tärkeäksi auttaa niin sodan keskellä olevia kuin Suomeen saapuvia ukrainalaisia. Mannerheimin Lastensuojeluliiton Varsinais-Suomen piiri alkoi kouluttaa paikallisia vapaaehtoisia vastaanottamaan Ukrainasta paenneita perheitä ja auttamaan heitä sopeutumaan uuteen arkeen Suomessa. Kokeilusta syntyi lopulta Naapuri-hanke, joka käynnistyi STEA-avustuksen myötä maaliskuussa 2023. Hankkeen käynnistyessä kohderyhmä laajentui koskettamaan kaikkia tukea tarvitsevia maahan muuttaneita lapsiperheitä.\n\n## Kotoutumista ja kulttuurien vuoropuhelua\n\nSomeron Naapuri-toiminnan ystäväperheet keilaamassa.\n\nNaapuri-toiminnan tavoitteena on tukea maahan muuttaneiden lapsiperheiden kotoutumista MLL:n paikallisyhdistysten tarjoamien kohtaamispaikkojen ja toiminnan, kuten perhekahviloiden, kerhojen ja erilaisten tapahtumien kautta. Naapuri-vapaaehtoiset tutustuttavat uusia naapureitaan uuteen arkeen esimerkiksi antamalla vinkkejä suomalaisiin sääolosuhteisiin, harrastusmahdollisuuksiin, luontoon tutustumiseen sekä käytännön arkeen.

Koen, että olimme silti hyvin läheisiä, hän tuntui omalta veljeltä ja sellaisena häntä pidin ja pidän edelleen.\n\n## Lastenkodin ihmiset perheenä\n\nHenkilökunta oli mielestäni mahtava! Ei liian montaa aikuista ja melkeinpä kaikkien kanssa oli läheinen suhde. Elämä lastenkodissa tuntui turvalliselta, oli rajoja ja rutiineita jotka loivat turvaa. Oli ihanaa, että teimme kaikki aikuiset ja lapset asioita yhdessä, kävimme rantamökillä ja saaristoissa yms reissuissa. Koen, että se lähensi meitä kaikkia tietyllä tavalla.

Korkeakoulutettu ja muita ihmisiä ammatikseen auttava Johanna ei nähnyt, että hän oli elänyt väkivaltaisessa suhteessa. Myöhemmin hän tajusi selittäneensä itselleen toisenlaista narratiivia todellisuuteen nähden. Pelko piti tiukasti kiinni suhteessa.\n\n- Minulle on tärkeää tuoda esiin, mitä kaikkea lähisuhdeväkivalta voi olla. Henkistä väkivaltaa on monesti myös vaikeampi tunnistaa, kun se tapahtuu piilossa eikä siitä jää fyysistä näkyvää jälkeä.

Se voi koskettaa ihan ketä tahansa, Johanna toteaa.\n\nKun omat voimat olivat poissa, itsetunto murennettu ja pelko hallitsi arkea, Pilarin tuki oli korvaamatonta.

Hankkeen tavoitteena oli tukea erityisesti alueiden 5–10-vuotiaiden lasten ja perheiden osallistumismahdollisuuksia lähialueiden liikuntaan, taiteeseen ja hyvinvointiin liittyviin harrastetoimintoihin sekä mahdollistaa lasten, nuorten ja perheiden osallisuuden kokemusten syntymistä.\n\nHankkeen aikana tehtyjä havaintoja, syntyneitä oivalluksia ja kerättyjä kokemuksia on julkaistu aiemmin syksyllä kahtena kokonaisuutena, jotka on suunnattu sekä perheille että ohjaajille. Perheille suunnatuissa videossa ja oppaassa käsitellään harrastamisen merkitystä, sen hyvinvointivaikutuksia, erilaisia harrastamisen muotoja ja saatavilla olevaa tukea. Ohjaajille suunnatuissa materiaaleissa puolestaan vastataan muun muassa kysymyksiin: Mitä on osallisuus harrastusryhmässä? Mitä asioita on hyvä huomioida monikielisen harrastusryhmän ohjaamisessa?\n\n## Saavutettavuus osallisuuden edellytyksenä\n\nNyt viimeisimpänä julkaistussa asiantuntijoille, harrastusten järjestäjille ja päättäjille suunnatussa julkaisussa käsitellään osallisuuden edellytyksiä.

Ensiksi käsittelyssä on harrastusten fyysinen ja sosiaalinen läheisyys, ja se, millaisia merkityksiä harrastuksen maantieteellisellä sijainnilla tai ohjaajalla henkilönä on harrastuksen saavutettavuuteen. Toiseksi käsitellään tiedon tavoittavuuteen liittyviä seikkoja, esimerkiksi sitä, mistä tietoa tarvitaan ja miten se olisi mahdollisimman tavoittavaa.

Ja tosiaan näitä nuoria, jotka meillä on kirjoittanut, he on tosiaan 15–21-vuotiaita nuoria, jotka tähän on osallistuneet. He on siis vapaamuotoisesti ja omakohtaisesti kirjoittanut heidän köyhyyden kokemuksesta meille ja tosiaan täysin anonyymisti nämä kirjoitukset on",

Sitten erilaiset järjestöt on meitä auttanut, erilaiset yhdistykset, sitten diakonia- ja nuorisotyöntekijät ja muut tällaiset eli tämmöisiä reittejä meidän kirjoitusaineistoon on siis hankittu kirjoittajia.

Tosiaan vastaajia me saatiin aika hyvin ympäri Suomen, mutta tosiaan 2/3 vastaajista on siis kaupungeista ja 1/3 aineiston vastaajista oli maaseudulta. Ja sukupuolijakaumasta näette, että hieman naissukupuoli painottui tässä meidän sukupuolijakaumasta, joskin me tavoitimme sitten muitakin sukupuolia ja muutama ei sitten halunnut meille sukupuoltaan kertoa, mutta tämmöinen sukupuolijakauma meidän aineistossa. Mutta tämä siitä meidän aineistosta, mihin tää päivän esitys liittyy.\n\nMutta tosiaan sitten mitä me sitten opittiin näistä, tästä meidän tutkimuksessa näistä nuorten köyhyyskokemuksista nykyajan Suomessa? Eli millaista se nuorten kokema köyhyys 2020-luvun suomessa sitten on? No tosiaan me tehtiin semmoinen aineistolähtöinen sisällönanalyysi näistä 84 kirjoituksesta ja me päädyttiin sitten tämmöiseen analyysiin meidän tutkimusryhmän kanssa. Eli siis nuorten kokema köyhyys ilmenee siis Suomessa siis kolmesta eri näkökulmasta. Eli nää 15–21-vuotiaat nuoret kuvasi, että heidän köyhyyskokemuksiin liittyy siis tämmöinen arjen välttämättömien perustarpeiden puutteellisuus.

Eli tämmöiseen kolmeen näkökulmaan meidän aineisto siis perustuu ja tosiaan tuossa on ehkä yks kirjoitus, jolla me aloitetaan tää kuvaus, eli joka aika hyvin tiivistää tätä nuorten kokemuksia. Tämä yksi kirjoittaja, 21-vuotias nainen kertoi, että hän on koko ikänsä kuunnellut opettajien, poliitikkojen ja hyväosaisten ikätovereiden hokevan, ettei suomessa olisi oikeaa köyhyyttä, eikä täällä kukaan olisi hengenvaarassa ja täällä olisi kaikki hyvin ja kaikkien pitäisi olla kiitollisia. Mutta tämä sit nuori kertoi kuitenkin, että hänen kokemuksensa oli täysin erilainen ja kuten tulette nyt näkemään näistä meidän aineisto viittauksista tai niiden tekemästä analyysistä, niin hyvin tämä 21-vuotiaan naisen kuvaus kuvaa tätä kokemusta.\n\nMutta tosiaan nämä arjen välttämättömien perustarpeiden puutteellisuus. No tosiaan tää sitten näkyi tällä tavalla. Eli tosiaan, kun me määrällisesti vähän tarkasteltiin aluksi näitä kirjoituksia, niin ehkä yksi tämmöinen, joka nousi aika huolettavankin paljon meidän näkökulmasta oli siis se, että määrällisesti suurimmat kirjoituksessa mainitut tarpeet oli ihan tämmöisiä perustarpeita ihmisten elämässä.

Eli siis tämmöinenkin kokemus liittyy siis nuorten köyhyyskokemukseen ihan meillä Suomessakin eli puutteellisuus ruoasta tai sen vähäisyys. Ja tässä nyt sitten näette millaisia asioita nuoret ihmiset oli meille kertonut. Esimerkiksi täällä 15-vuotias tyttö kertoi, että hän huomaa köyhyyden päivittäin, kun ajattelee, että onko tänään mahdollisuus syödä ruokaa. Ei koskaan tiedä, odottaako kotona lämmin ateria vai tyhjä ruokapöytä. Eli ihan 15-vuotias tyttökin kertoi meille tällaista. Sitten meillä oli esimerkiksi 18-vuotias nainen kertoi, että köyhyys esiintyy enimmäkseen viikoittaisessa ruoan hankinnassa, jossa pitää miettiä erittäin tarkkaan mitä pitää ostaa. Kuinka paljon se tulee maksamaan nykyisen inflaation vuoksi? Eli tosiaan nuorilla tämä, erityisesti 2022, joskin tilanne ei ole paljon muuttunut. Tätä inflaatiota siis on näkynyt heidän kirjoituksissaan, eli paljon oli kirjoituksia tästä ruoan hinnoista. Ja sitten se liittyykin näihin kulutustuotteisiin muutenkin, erityisesti vaatteissa näkyy. Muun muassa 16-vuotias poika kertoi, että vaatteissa, kuten muissakin kulutustuotteissa ollaan menty halvimmalla mahdolliseen. Ja sitten tosiaan näihin vaatteisiin liittyy tämmöinen aika vahva sosiaalinen elementti näissä nuorten kirjoituksissa. Eli tosiaan nuorten kesku",

Ja tosiaan siitä sitten seurasi usein vähän ikäviä seurauksia, että täällä esimerkiksi 19-vuotias kertoi, että hän on pukeutunut muiden mielestä huonoihin vaatteisiin, jonka takia häntä on myös siis kiusattu. Eli tosiaan tälleen näkyi nämä perustarpeet. Ja tosiaan näihin liittyen sitten oli ihan muitakin tämmöisiä perustarpeita, joita nuorten perheissä jouduttiin tinkimään muun muassa lämmityksestä ja sähköstä ja myös bensasta esimerkiksi maaseudulla. Esimerkiksi 16-vuotias kertoi, että heidän heillä arki on tällaista perheessä, että rahat on niukassa ja se näkyy silleen, ettei voi olla esimerkiksi suihkussa kauaa. Laturit pois seinästä, valot pois päältä. Eli tämmöistä on opittu perheessä, tämmöisiä säästämistapoja. Tosiaan sitten myös kerrottiin tämmöisestä puutteellisesta asumisesta. Muun muassa tässä 15-vuotias poika kertoi näinkin hankalasta tilanteesta eli asun äitini, isäni ja kahden sisaruksen kanssa pienessä yksiössä. Meillä on todella huono rahatilanne, ei ole rahaa edes kunnolla ruokaan ja joudun käyttämään samoja vaatteita monta päivää.

Ja koko talo on ihan todella kylmä talvisin, niin siellä palelee, kun ei ole varaa laittaa edes yhtä astetta isommalla lämmitystä. Eli ihan tämmöisistä perusasioistakin oli tämä, köyhyys näkyi sitten.\n\nJa erityisesti sitten tässä maaseutupuolen aineistossa me huomattiin tämmöisiä tiettyjä maaseutupainotteisuutta esimerkiksi näissä bensaan ja liikkumiseen liittyvissä kysymyksissä, että esimerkiksi siellä paljon nuoret kertoi meille tämmöisestä, jota kutsutaan liikenneköyhyydeksi. Eli tosiaan liikkuminen oli hankaloitunut tämän köyhyyden ja pienituloisuuden ja erityisesti inflaation takia. Eli tosiaan, tässä kuvassa esimerkiksi 19-vuotias maaseudulla asuva nainen, että hän huomaa olevan köyhä, koska hänen täytyy miettiä mistä saa rahaa bensaan. Että voi käydä koulussa joka ikinen päivä ja aina sitä rahaa ei ole ja tämän takia koulunkäyntinikin on kärsinyt. Eli tosiaan tämmöinen liikkuminen sitten oli hankaloitunut tämän köyhyyden takia sitten ja erityisesti inflaation kanssa. Ja siihen inflaatioon ja hintojen nousuun liittyen.

Esimerkiksi 15-vuotias tyttö kertoi tästä, että hänelle vanhemmat kertovat laskuista ja hinnoista ja silti se aiheuttaa stressiä. Vaikka tämä 15-vuotias tyttö ei edes itse ole vastuussa laskuista tai hinnoista tai maksamisesta. Että tosiaan tämä köyhyysstressi selvästi siis heijastuu perheessä kanssa. Se me todettiin tässä meidän analyysissa, myös siis perheen nuorimpiin. Sitten tosiaan oli tämmöisiä kokemuksia, kaupassa käymisestä oli paljon. Arvioitiin, että tämä on mahdollisesti tämmöistä opittua käytöstä sitten vanhemmilta eli on opittu se. Tässä 15-vuotias tyttö kertoi, että on oppinut siihen, että joka kerralla, kun käyn kaupassa, niin ekana katsotaan hintalappua ja sitten vasta, että onko tuote ostamisen arvoinen. Ja paljon oli tätä kaupoissa käynti kuvaamisia eli oli tämmöistä vaikka, että tunnetaan itsensä köyhäksi, kun käy kaupassa eli kassalla huomataan hintojen suuri nousu. Ja sitten opintotuki koettiin, että se ei riitä edes maksamaan kuukauden ruokia, koska siitä menee osa vuokranmaksuun, vesilaskuun ja kallistuneen sähköön.

Erityisesti, kun hinnat on noussut ja inflaatiota on ollut.\n\nMutta sitten oli tämmöistä harrastusten poisjäämistä kuvattu paljon. Eli koska harrastusten hinnat on noussut, niin sitten tässä 17-vuotias kertoi, että harrastukset on sen takia jäänyt pois, kun niihin ei ole enää varaa ja ystävien kanssa tapaillut vähentynyt, kun heidän luokseen on pitkä matka ja bensan hinnat on korkealla, niin kulkuvälineiden käyttöä tulee miettiä tarkoin. Ja tosiaan tuokin oli sieltä maaseudulta kuvaus, tämä 17-vuotiaan tytön kuvaus, että harrastukset on vaikeampia, kun ei ole varaa enää liikkua.\n\nMutta sitten köyhyys oli myös tämmöistä heikompaa sosiaalisina verkostoina. Eli sekin kuuluu tähän nuoruuden köyhyyskokemukseen Suomessa. Tämmöinen sosiaalisten verkostojen heikentyminen ja siihen kuuluu monenlaisia erilaisia näkökulmia, mutta tähän me ollaan nyt tiivistetty ne. Se oli erityisesti tämmöistä niinku ulkopuolisuutta, köyhyyden salaamista ja sitten niinku kiusatuksi tulemista omassa sosiaalisessa ympäristössä. Eli tosiaan köyhyys oli tosi voimakkaasti myös tämmöinen sosiaalinen kokemus. Ja erityisesti etääntymisen kokemus muista oli vahva tässä.

Ja sitten tässä on 15-vuotias tyttö kuvannut, että tulee paha mieli pyytää äidiltä mitään, kun se vastaa, ettei ole rahaa tai jättää välistä esim. kavereiden kanssa olon, ettei ne saisi tietää, että olen köyhä. Ja 18-vuotias kertoo myös, että koen köyhyyttä, kun katson somesta, miten muut käyvät festareilla, leffassa, huvipuistoissa, matkoilla, muissa hauskoissa jutuissa. Itsellä ei ole tällaisiin varaa. Ja 15-vuotias poika kertoi myös, että köyhyys ei tunnu mukavalta, kun saa paljon syrjintää, haukkumista siitä, että ei omista rahaa. Eli siis hyvin, hyvin tämmöinen sosiaalinen kokemus tämä köyhyys nuorille on ja se näkyy monessa eri nuoruuden vaiheessa.\n\nJa sitten se oli myös tämmöisiä negatiivisia tunnetiloja, eli sitä oli todella paljon kuvattu. Erityisesti tämä ahdistus, stressi ja häpeä. Nää oli varmaan ne suurimmat negatiiviset tunnetilat mitä nuoret kuvasi, että tää oli todella voimakas tämmöinen negatiivisten tunnetilojen aiheuttaja tää köyhyys heidän elämässä.

Aina ollut köyhä ja en varmaan tästä pääse. Sitä mukaa, kun sais enemmän rahaa nii hinnat nousee. En jaksa uskoa, että saisin elämästä enää mitään ikinä irti. Koska kaikki vaatii rahaa. Eli todella niin kuin tämmöisen hankalan ja vaikean negatiivisen tunnetilan on köyhyys hänelle aiheuttanut. Ja sitten on tämmöisiä kokemuksia, esimerkiksi 20-vuotias nainen kuvasi, että tunnen itseni huonoksi ihmiseksi, kun en voi samalla tasolla kuin muut olla ja se tuntuu todella pahalta ja tunnen tämän takia itseni yksinäiseksi. Ja 16-vuotias tyttö kuvasi myös tätä köyhyyden salailua ja sitten siihen liittyvää stressiä eli häpeän köyhyyttäni koska kaikki koulukaverit on hyvätuloisista perheistä. Tämän vuoksi pyrin parhaani mukaan salaamaan asuinpaikkani ja muutenkin näyttää epäköyhältä.

Esimerkiksi 18-vuotias nainen kirjoitti näin, että köyhyyden kanssa pystyy olla kuitenkin luova ja nykyään jos tavara hajoaa, osaa olla luova ja keksii tapoja, miten pidentää tavaran elämää. Olen oppinut ansaitsemaan rahaa erilaisilla tavoilla. Pulloja keräämällä, tavaroita myymällä, pikkuasioita tekemällä, lapsenvahtina. En voi olla myöskään nirso ruoan kanssa ja olen kasvanut kiitolliseksi ja nöyräksi. Sitten oli toinen 18-vuotias kuvannut tälleen, että hän on kiitollinen koululle ja valtiolle, kun koulumatka on kustannettu peruskoulun ajan ja kaikki eivät opi arvostamaan sitä mitä heillä jo on. Arvostusta ja kiitollisuutta ei opeteta koulussa, vaan se pitää jokaisen itse oppia. Kiittämättömiä Ihmiset ovat myös osittain köyhiä, koska he eivät osaa tarpeeksi kiitollisia. Eli oli pohdittu tämmöistä kiitollisia, että mitkä asiat on sentään, mistä ollaan kiitollisia tai tämmöisiä pohdittu yleisesti, että olisiko jotain mitä voisi tässä köyhyys kontekstissa pohtia tämmöisiä asioita. No, sitten oli myös kuvattu, 17-vuotias tyttö oli kuvannut, että ”Olen kuullut ilkeitä kommentteja, jäänyt yksin, elänyt halvoilla elintarvikkeilla, mutta koin sen kasvattaneeni min",

Minä näen vaivaa, jos haluan jotain. Minä teen itse töitä ja ymmärrän rahan arvon.” Eli tosiaan hienosti pohdittu tämmöisiä asioitakin näissä nuorten kirjoituksissa. Eli nuoret oikein fiksusti osaisi tämmöisiäkin pohdiskella. Mutta tässä oli varmaan nämä meidän päänäkökulmat, mitä me aineistossa huomattiin ja nyt muistaakseni olisi nyt varmaan Anna-Marian vaihe sitten pohtia näitä mitä tästä voisi ammattilaisena ottaa näistä nuorten kirjoituksista itselleen pohdittavaksi tai mietittäväksi. Ole hyvä Anna-Maria.\n\n[Anna-Maija Isola] Mitä voisi ammattilaisena ja sitten jälkimmäisellä kalvolla, kun sen aika tulee niin myös se, että mitä voisi ihmisenä ottaa pohdittavaksi köyhyyden vastaiseen työhön? Suomessa on tavattu tai meillä on Suomessa niinku köyhyys on suhteellista ja suhteellista nimenomaan silleen, että se on niin kun tulonjakoon liittyvä mittari se suhteellinen köyhyysraja. Ja klassisesti me erotellaan suhteellinen köyhyys absoluuttisesta mitä suomessa ei ole. Mutta kuten ehkä saatoitte tuolta Tonin mainitsemista lainauksista huomata, niin osa nuorista on aika pinteessä siinä elämässään, että koska ei ole semmoista päätäntävaltaa ja hallittavuutta siihen, että miten ne kotitalouden rahat mahdollisesti jakautuu tai että ei ole varmuutt",

Mä ajattelen, että me on ajateltu ja vähän pohdittukin sitä muistaakseni siinä artikkelissa, että tämmöisissä tilanteissa se nuorten köyhyys niin kuin lähestyy jo semmoista absoluuttista köyhyyttä. Siksi, että ei ole hallittavuutta eikä ole tietoa ja eikä siis välttämättä oo sitä lämmintä ateriaa siellä. No sitten mä sitten tota me ollaan pohdittu myös sitä, että ehkä sitä nuorten kokemaan köyhyyttä niin kuvaisi paremmin semmoinen käsite, kun ”toimintavalmiuksien köyhyys”. Mitä mä käsittelen tulevassa artikkelissa, mikä ei ole vielä Julkaistu. Mutta sillä koitan havainnollistaa sitä, että nuoruudessa on kauhean tärkeätä se, että mitä tehdään yhdessä kavereiden kanssa ja miten voidaan keskittyä siksi ihanaksi ihmiseksi, kun jollaiseksi on syntynyt, niin kasvaa sellaiseksi ihmiseksi. Ja silloin kysymys on tota niin kun niistä toimintavalmiuksista, että voi toteuttaa itseensä ja näissä niinku lainauksissa tuli niinku esiin se, että tosi monet näistä toimintavalmiuksista on sitoutunut rahaa, että tosi moni asia niinku nuorten maailmassa on, on niin kun tarvitaan rahaa ja siihen liittyy myös semmoiset tietyt niinku statuskamppailut.

Ja sitten tähän suojautumispuoleen niin puhutaan tällaisista eri tasoisista resilienssitekijöistä yksilö, yhteisö, yhteiskunta tasoilla. Inspiraatio tähän ehkä lähti siitä kun minä professori Tiina Ristikarin kanssa Itlasta pidettiin tällainen Lapsuuden rakentajat -podcast, joka on edelleen Itlan sivuilla kuultavana, ja suosittelen sitä, että siinä oli vuoropuhelua Tiinan kanssa näistä köyhyysasioista ja nyt esiinnyn vain yksikseni tässä. Lyhyesti tästä aivojen muovautuvuudesta eli koko meidän kehitys ja ihmisen kehitys ja oppiminen, perustuvat sille että aivot ovat muovautuvat. Aivot muovautuvat jatkuvasti erilaisten ympäristötekijöiden ja kokemusten seurauksena, eli erilaiset aistiärsykkeet mitä me meidän aistikanavien kautta päivän aikana saadaan, ne kaikki osallistuu meidän aivojen muovaamiseen.

Tai sitten voi olla niin, että stressihormonitaso pysyy kauhean korkealla ja sekään ei ole hyvä. Eli tavallaan ihmisen keho ja aivot tarvitsisivat sellaisen joustavasti toimivan stressinsäätelyjärjestelmän, joka käynnistyy kun sitä tarvitaan ja palautuu sitten niin, että elimistö pääsee tarvittaessa aina palautumaan lepotilaan.

Säätely on se juttu. Aivojen pitää oppia säätelemään niitä stressireaktioita ja sen takia sellainen maailma, jossa ei olisi mitään kuormitusta tai mitään vaatimuksia, niin sekään ei ole hyvä, koska silloin lapsen omat aivot eivät opi säätelemään niitä reaktioita.\n\nSellainen tilanne, jossa tulee aivan liikaa kuormitusta, on tilanne jossa lapselle kertyy paljon haitallisia elämäntapahtumia ja käytetään ihan suomenkielisessäkin kirjallisuudessa tällaista ACE-termiä, joka tulee englannin adverse childhood experiences sanasta. ACE on jotenkin sellainen joka on uinut tähän suomalaiseenkin kielenkäyttöön.

Joka tapauksessa jos nämä haitalliset elämäntapahtumat aiheuttavat toksista stressiä, niin sitten on vaara että niistä seuraa terveyshaittoja. Erityisesti on todettu, että riski on suuri jos näitä tapahtumia kasaantuu ja suojaavia tapahtumia puuttuu. Haitallisten tapahtumien kasaantuminen lisää lapsen riskiä, tässä on tällainen histogrammi kaavakuva, jossa todetaan, että jos on yli kuusi tai seitsemän näitä haitallisia tapahtumia, niin on lähes sadan prosentin riski, että lapselle tulee joitakin kehityksellisiä viiveitä.

Mekanismit ovat monenlaiset, toisaalta vanhempien kuormitus on potentiaalisesti lapselle toksisen stressin lähde. Mitä nuorempi lapsi sitä suorempi se yhteys on, mutta vielä nuoruusikäisetkin ottavat sen vanhempien kuormituksen ikään kuin omaksi kuormituksekseen. Ja sitten lapsen itsensä tähän köyhyyteen liittyvien asioiden, esimerkiksi erottautuminen ikätoverien, koulu tai harrastus tilanteissa, niin lapset ovat aika tarkkoja ja tietoisia näistä tämmöisistä eroista suhteessa muihin lapsiin, ja jos se köyhyys johtaa tämmöiseen ulkopuolisuuden kokemukseen ja erilaisuuteen, niin silloin se on lapselle suoraan siinä omassa ympäristössä toksisen stressin lähde.

Heikommista lähtökohdista tulevat lapset saivat selkeän lisäavun siinä, että koulu oli hyvä. Tämä näkyy erityisesti äidinkielen ja matikan arvosanoissa. Perimän puolesta hyväosaiset, tässä oli siis ihan katsottu tämmöistä geneettistä riskikerrointa. Tämä oli ihan tällainen kovan tason tutkimus, yli 20 000 lasta, niin perimän puolesta hyväosaiset eivät saaneet mitään erityistä lisäapua siitä, että koulu oli hyvä, he pärjäsivät joka tapauksessa keksitasoa paremmin, mutta heillä ei ole väliä. Naapurustoon liittyvät tekijät eivät määrittäneet oppimistuloksia, eli koulu on sen oppimisen ja koulutusasioiden kannalta se tärkein lähioppimisympäristö, ja siinä nimenomaan pitäisi nyt sitten investoida niihin lapsiin ja nuoriin, joilla lähtökohdat eivät ole niin hyvät, mutta he pystyvät kuromaan kiinni kunhan se ympäristö on sille suotuisa.\n\nLopputoteamana tämä köyhyyden aiheuttaman tai muiden lapsuuden elinolojen aiheuttaman toksisen stressin laajat mahdolliset terveyshaitat pitäisi",

Lähdetään siitä sillä tavalla, että ihan lyhyesti määrittelen, että mistä puhutaan kun puhutaan yksinäisyydestä. Eli yksinäisyys on aina semmoinen toiveiden ja todellisuuden välinen olotila. Voi olla, että toivoo vaikka viittä ystävää ja jos ne on niin sitten ei ole yksinäinen. Mutta jos kaipaa jotain muuta kuin mitä sillä hetkellä on, niin silloin tulee se ahdistava, pahan olon tunne siitä, että jotakin puuttuu. Toivoisi jotakin muuta, kuin sitä mitä on. Eli jollakin lapsella voi olla valtava määrä sellaisia sosiaalisia verkostoja tai välitunnit seistä muiden kanssa, mutta silti hän voi kokea, että kukaan ei jotenkin ole samalla aaltopituudella, ei ole ketään keneen voisi täysin luottaa tai ketään kenelle voisi kertoa niistä kaikista omista ajatuksista.\n\nEli yksinäisyys tieteen määritelminä on aina se negatiivinen, ahdistava, kurja olotila, joka syntyy siitä, että ei joko ole niitä kavereita verkostoa, porukkaa tai ei ole sitä läheistä, tärkeää, omaa ystävää. Eli sosiaalinen yksinäisyys on sitä verkostojen puutetta ja emotionaalinen sitä läheisen, tärkeän, luotettavan ystävän puutetta. Näihin lähelle ",

Pienetkin lapset voivat kaivata niitä yksin vietettyjä hetkiä, mutta silloin jos se muuttuu pysyväksi ja ikäväksi olotilaksi, niin silloin se on yksinäisyyttä.\n\nMyös sosiaalinen eristäytyneisyys on ehkä lähellä oleva termi. Se voi johtua siitä, että on tullut jotenkin satutetuksi tai loukatuksi, ja sen takia vetäytyy erillisyyteen muista tai sitten vaikka koronapandemian aikana, kuten hyvin muistatte, niin silloinhan oli paljon tätä sosiaalista eristäytyneisyyttä eli piti olla syystä tai toisesta erillään muista ihmisistä. Molemmilla, sekä yksinäisyydellä että sosiaalisella eristäytyneisyydellä on ikäviä vaikutuksia psyykkiseen ja fyysiseen terveyteen.

Tai opettajalla on luokassa niin paljon lapsia, että aika ei millään riitä heihin kaikkiin. Tai sitten voi olla palvelujärjestelmässä sosiaali- ja terveydenhuollossa jotenkin ruuhkaa ja kiirettä eikä jotenkin ehditä kohdata sitä asiakasta, lasta tai nuorta, jotenkin niin paljon että hänelle tulisi se tunne, että hän on varmasti kuultu ja kohdattu ja hänen asiansa tulee jotenkin huomioiduksi.\n\nEn puhu tänään paljonkaan yksinäisyyden syistä, minkä takia yksinäisyyttä koetaan, mutta nostin yhden tähän teemaan liittyvän asian. Siellä on siis paljon totta kai kaikkia opittuja malleja mutta myös niitä perittyjä ominaisuuksia ja ehkä siihenkin liittyy ne kotona varhaisessa vaiheessa opitut tavat toimia ja tavat tietysti ratkaista ristiriitoja muiden kanssa ja olla vuorovaikutuksessa. Mutta hollantilais- ja amerikkalaistutkijat ovat löytäneet myös geneettisen perimäosuuden, eli osa yksinäisyyden kokemuksesta ja tunteesta voi periytyä tai periytyy geneettisesti, vaikka ujoutena, arkuutena, erilaisina malleina, fysiologisina reaktioina, mutta mitä pienemmästä lapsesta on kyse, niin sitä enemmän perityt ominaisuudet selittää sitä yksinäisyyttä.

Totta kai se ympäristön vaikutus on aina positiivisempi jos ne lähtökohdat ovat positiivisia, eli tämä on yksi meidän otsikon asioista, miksi yksinäisyys eriarvoistaa, niin on se että jos ne lähtökohdat, niihin sosiaalisiin suhteisiin, vuorovaikutukseen, muiden lasten kanssa toimimiseen on erilaisia, niin silloin usein polut alkavat jakautua jo siinä pienillä lapsilla ja varsinkin sitten nuoruudessa.\n\nYmmärtääkö pienet lapset mitä yksinäisyys on? Miltä tuntuu kun jää ulkopuolisuuteen? Usein ajatellaan, että ei ne meidän pienet vielä välttämättä sitä ymmärrä tai ei lapset koe yksinäisyyttä tai ulkopuolisuutta, että se tulee sitten vasta nuoruuden ja erilaisten identiteettien kriisien ja kehityksen kautta tai muuta. Joku määritelmä sanoo, että yksinäisyyttä voi kokea ainoastaan jos on aikaisemmin ollut hyvät sosiaaliset suhteet. Mutta toiset määritelmät, esimerkiksi Baumeisterin ja kumppaneiden sanoo, että yksinäisyys tai tunne ulkopuolisuudesta ja erityisesti tarve yhteenkuuluvuuteen muille ihmisille, niin se on sellainen fundamentaali, ihan perustavanlaatuinen tarve joka meillä jokaisella on ihan pienestä lähtien.

Minkä takia yksinäisyys ei tunnu pahalta ainoastaan sillä hetkellä, kun sitä koetaan. Vaan miten se vaikuttaa pitkällekin sinne tulevaisuuteen. Miten tunne siitä, ettei ole yhtäläiset lähtökohdat, koska ei saa yhtäläisesti sitä kuuluvuuden kokemusta muiden kanssa. Niin miten ne alkaa usein siinä lapsuudessa ja lähtee siirtymään sinne nuoruuteen. Mutta tässä oli siis syntymäkohorttitutkimuksessa 8-vuotiailta pojilta kysytty heidän yksinäisyyden tunteitaan. Ja katsottu sitten kymmenen vuoden päähän, että miten ne näkyvät armeijan kutsuntakyselyissä ja terveystarkastuksissa erilaisina asioina. Ja täällä nämä pienet kahdeksan vuotiaat pojat, jotka sillä hetkellä koki yksinäisyyttä, ulkopuolisuutta, ystävien puutetta tai sitä että kukaan ei välitä heistä, niin näillä pienillä pojilla kymmenen vuoden kuluttua, 18-vuotiaana aikuisuuden kynnyksellä, niin he kokivat edelleen enemmän yksinäisyyttä kuin muut.

Sitä, että se paha olo joka syntyy siitä, että tuntuu ettei kukaan välitä ja kukaan ei halua olla sinun kanssa, olet jotenkin muiden ulkopuolinen, niin se voi saada meidät toimimaan myös niin että puretaan sitä pahaa oloa ulospäin, erilaisena epäsosiaalisena käyttäytymisenä ja rötöstelynä, jopa muunlaisina, hyvinkin negatiivisina asioina.

Tavallaan ajatukset ja tunteet sille, että pystyy itse vaikuttamaan elämäänsä, pystyy tekemään asioita joita haluaa, ja näkee sellaisen merkityksellisyyden kokemuksen.

Tai ajatella että nyt suoriudun hyvin koulusta ja sitten saan hyvän opiskelupaikan ja menen sinne työelämään ja hankin perheen tai muuta. Tämä näkyy erityisen hyvin ehkä Suomen Punaisen Ristin yksinäisyysbarometrissa, joka julkaistiin tämän vuoden helmikuussa. Siellä oli noussut erityisesti sellaisten nuorten ihmisten osuus, jotka kokivat, etteivät he enää pysty itse vaikuttamaan siihen omaan tilanteeseensa.

Käytin äsken noita lasten ja nuorten itsensä kokemuksia jotenkin avatakseni sitä ilmiötä, mutta jos me katsomme ihan tieteellisistä tutkimuksista niin mitä siellä tapahtuu, minkä takia yksinäisyys, vaikka usein ajatellaan, että se on ihan pieni asia, niin minkä takia se saa aikaan vähän niin kuin hyökyaaltoja tai vyöryjä, että se alkaa vaikutta tosi moneen eri asiaan. Siihen, että mitä ajattelet tulevaisuudesta tai itsestäsi, miten tarvitset erilaisia viimesijaisiakin palveluita tai millainen terveys, hyvinvointi sinulla on. Eli kokemus ulkopuolisuudesta saa ihmisen tuntemaan uhkaa omaa olemassaoloa, merkityksellisyyttä, yhdenvertaisia vaikutusmahdollisuuksia ja tasa-arvoa kohtaan. Se kokemus aktivoituu sosiaalisena kipuna, sen takia se tuntuu usein, että se satuttaa paljon ja voidaan kuvailla, että se on kuin kylmää vettä niskaan tai isku vasten kasvoja. Tai jotain muuta. Ja nämä uhkaavat tilanteet saavat aikaan stressireaktioita ja ne näkyy siellä kortisoleissa ja erilaisia pelkotiloja.\n\nPoistin tästä diasta lähteet noihin tieteellisiin artikkeleihin, mutta tuolla alla on tuo linkki tuoh",

Se aiheuttaa kognitiivista kuormittuneisuutta, vähän niin kuin ylikierroksia siinä kognitiivisessa toiminnassa, joka tietenkin heikentää oppimista. On vaikka mahdotonta keskittyä siihen Pythagoraan lausekkeeseen, jos olet kokenut välitunnilla sitä että sinua työnnetään ulkopuolisuuteen tai kukaan ei näe sinua tai sinua kiusataan tai syrjitään tai torjutaan, ihan mitä tahansa niitä ulkopuolisuuden asioita.

Mutta asenneilmapiirin muutos, mikä siinä on olennaista on se, mikä meidän lapsilta ja nuorilta usein tulee haastatteluissa ja erilaisissa teksteissä toiveena on se, että joku kysyisi, mitä sinulle kuuluu, miten sinulla menee. Meillä kaikilla on tarve tulla, ainakin jossakin määrin, joillakin enemmän joillakin vähemmän, nähdyksi, kuulluksi ja kohdatuksi. Täällä on yhden nuoren kommentti siihen, että hän ei ’’kaipaa sääliä tai neuvoja, vaan sitä, että joku huomaisi, että minäkin olen olemassa.’’ Sitä että joku tervehtisi pihalla ja pyytäisi mukaan leikkeihin. Istuisi viereen vaikka hiekkalaatikolla tai välitunnilla tulisi kysymään, että mitä kuuluu.

Eli suomalaisten painajaisia, miten se onkin meille painajainen, että bussipysäkki onkin jo varattu, kun siellä seisoo yksi ihminen ja vaikka sataisi kaatamalla niin seistään siinä katoksen ulkopuolella, koska eihän voi mennä liian lähelle muita. Tai hissitilanne jotenkin painajaisena, että siellä onkin joku toinen ihminen. Tämä hissi on ehkä suosikkini liittyen siihen Turun Louhen parkkihalliin, jossa on tosi hidas hissi ja jossa tuntuu, ettei ikinä ole tarpeeksi montaa tyhjää nurkkaa, jotta jokainen voisi tuijottaa omaansa. Tämä on jotakin sellaista, mikä osuu meihin ja uppoaa. Mutta toisaalta tämä on myös sitä mikä ylläpitää meidän tunnetta siitä, että pysytään erossa muista. Ei hymyillä, ei kohdata, ei nähdä eikä kuulla toisia.\n\nEli ajatuksena se, että miten me saisimme tämän introvertin, vetäytyvän suomalaisuuden muuttumaan, ei mitenkään amerikkalaiseksi tai etelä-eurooppalaiseksi valtavaksi sosiaalisuudeksi. Ei meistä ikinä tule sellaisia, että puhuisimme aina kaikille tai olisimme aina sosiaalisia, eikä meistä tarvitsekaan tulla sellaisia.

Ja yhtäkkiä yksi niistä nuorista kiepsahti ympäri ja muut jäi siihen odottamaan ja palelemaan, että mitä sinä nyt teet. Ja tämä nuori meni takaisin siihen ovelle pitämään sitä ovea auki äidille, joka tuli siitä lastenrattaiden kanssa ulos. Ja hän totesin niille muille nuorille, jotka odottivat että ’’this is how we do things in Finland’’. Se oli mielestäni ihana toteamus, sellainen faktana otettava asia että näin me toimitaan Suomessa. Me pidämme huolta siitä, joka tulee vastaan tai kävelee meidän perässä ovesta ulos. Me uskallamme huomata ja nähdä.

Onko tutkimustietoa tästä asiasta, erityisesti nyt lasten ja nuorten kohdalla?’’\n\n[Niina Junttila] Kyllä, hyvä kysymys, on yhteydessä varmastikin. Siitä löytyy joitain tutkimuksia, joissa se on erikseen todettu siellä, erityisesti kansainvälisiä. Luulen että Suomestakin on, en osaa sanoa tarkkaan mikä tutkimus sen toteaisi, mutta tiedän että niitä on ainakin tekeillä ja on löydetty yhteyksiä, paitsi neurokirjon asioihin niin kaikenlaisten erilaisten toimintamallien ja ajatusten kanssa. Ihmiset jotka kuuluvat johonkin erilaisuutta kokevaan vähemmistöön, niin heillä on aina suurempi riski siihen yksinäisyyden tunteeseen.\n\n[Helka VSLJ] Aivan. Seuraava kysymys: ’’Millaisia konkreettisia tekoja näet että tarvittaisiin aikuisilta, erityisesti niin pienempien lasten kuin nuorten yhteisöjen vahvistamiseksi?’’\n\n[Niina Junttila] Ihana kysymys. Toivon, että jokainen aikuinen ottaisi asiakseen, että lopetettaisiin syyllisten etsiminen siinä mielessä, että ei ajateltaisi, että se on kotien vika tai koulujen vika tai varhaiskasvatuksen tai päättäjien vika, vaan ajateltaisiin, että me jokainen voimme tehdä asioita toisin.

Kysyä, että mitä kuuluu tai miten menee. Meillä oli juuri nuori henkilö jolta me kysyimme, että mitä te nuoret haluaisitte, että me aikuiset tekisimme tai sanoisimme, jos tulette puhumaan siitä, että teillä on paha olla ja se oli tosi viisas se ajatus, että älkää alkako heti tekemään vaan kysykää mitä se nuori haluaisi. Koska jos aletaan vain hosumaan ja tekemään asioita, niin se voi mennä pahemmaksi. Se että uskallettaisiin kysyä, että mitä sinä haluaisit, miten voisin sinua auttaa niin se on nuorten mielestä kaikkein tärkein. Eikä he oleta, että meillä on aina valmiita vastauksia, mutta he olettavat että olisimme valmiita kuuntelemaan. Kaikki mahdolliset sosiaaliset vuorovaikutustaidot, mallin näyttäminen, se miten kohtelemme toisiamme, pienten lasten harrastuksiin tai kerhoihin tai hiekkalaatikolle vieminen, sosiaalisten kontaktien järjestäminen, se että tehdään kotien ja koulujen välillä yhteistyötä, aikuiset yhdessä huolehditaan niistä meidän pienistä.

Vai onko tämä selitettävissä suomalaisella luonteenlaadulla ja ihan ainutlaatuisuudella?\n\n[Niina Junttila] Yksinäisyys on ihan universaalia, kaikissa maissa koetaan yksinäisyyttä. Suomi on itseasiassa ollut aika pohjilla prevalenssitilastoissa, eli siellä kuinka paljon suomalaiset sanoo kokevansa yksinäisyyttä. Nyt me olemme ihan siellä kärkikastissa muiden maiden joukossa, mutta se ei tarkoita, että se yksinäisyys olisi samanlaista. Kerron usein esimerkkinä kun teimme suomalaisten ja kreikkalaisten koululaisten välillä yksinäisyystutkimusta ja kreikkalaiset vastasivat useammin olevansa yksinäisiä. Joten tehtiin niin että minä haastattelin suomalaisia, kollega kreikkalaisia lapsia, ja siellä yksinäisyyden syy lapsilla oli vaikka se, että paras kaverini ei tullut tänään kouluun niin koen, ettei minulla ole ketään. Meillä se oli sitä, että kukaan ei edes muista minun nimeä tai mua ei koskaan nähdä ja oteta mukaan leikkeihin. Eli siinä on ilmiönä paljon kansallisia ja kulttuurisia piirteitä, erityisesti se että me arvostetaan sitä että selviää yksinään ja jokainen pitää huolen omista asioista.

Voidaan varmasti sanoa, että jollain tavalla meillä on oppimista ja mielenterveyttä koskeva kriisi, ja tarvitsisimme enemmän osaamista ja ymmärrystä ja ennen kaikkea resursseja, että miten me voisimme auttaa meidän lapsia ja nuoria niin, että he voisivat paremmin.  Välttämättä tämä ei tarkoita sitä, että häiriöitä olisi jotenkin merkittävästi enemmän, mutta ainakin me voimme sanoa, että meidän palvelujärjestelmä ei tällä hetkellä riitä tarjoamaan tukea ja apua kaikille tarvitseville.

Nykylapsia ja -nuoria kuormittaa erilaiset asiat, erityisesti arkirutiinit ja arjen asiat, koulun kaverisuhteet ja tämän tyyppiset asiat. Ja aika iso osa erityisesti tytöistä raportoi myös aika merkittäviä ahdistusoireita. Mutta sitten samanaikaisesti haluan painottaa myös toista puolta. Muistaakseni jopa yli 90 prosenttia näihin kyselyihin täyttäneistä lapsista ja nuorista samanaikaisesti olivat tyytyväisiä elämäänsä, ja kokivat että heidän elämänlaatunsa on hyvää ja kokivat myös aika paljon ihan sellaista onnellisuuden tunnetta. Eli on tärkeää nähdä, että monella tapaa meidän lapset ja nuoret voivat myös hyvin ja kun pohdimme tätä asiaa, on tärkeää jotenkin huomioida näitä eri näkökulmia ja ennen kaikkea, että löydettäisiin ne lapset ja nuoret, jotka ovat erityisen suuressa riskissä ja joiden elämässä erilaiset riski- ja huolitekijät kasaantuu, koska se on varmasti se ryhmä lapsia joka tarvitse apua ja jonka tarpeisiin meidän palvelujärjestelmä ei pysty riittävällä tavalla tällä hetkellä vastaamaan.

Mutta jos mietitään lapsen aivojen kehitystä jossa sitten se perusta sille myöhemmälle kehitykselle rakentuu, niin ne ensimmäiset kolme vuotta ovat kaikkein kriittisin vaihe. Ja sitten se toinen kriittinen vaihe aivojen kehityksen jälkeen tulee tuolla nuoruusiässä. Jos mietitään milloin olisi erityisen tärkeää panostaa siihen lapsen kasvuympäristöön, tietenkin koko lapsuuden ajan, mutta ehkä aivan erityisesti näissä herkkyysvaiheissa, eli pikkulapsi- ja nuoruusvaiheissa.

Ja tietenkin lapsen syntymän jälkeen lapsi lähtee vuorovaikuttamaan oman kasvuympäristönsä kanssa ja silloin se kasvuympäristön osuus entisestään suurenee ja laajenee, ja siinä varhaisessa vaiheessa se perhesuhde on kaikista tärkein. Yhtä tärkeää kuin on huomioida ne erilaiset kasvuympäristöt ja tekijät sieltä raskausajasta lähtien, niin on todella tärkeää huomioida lapsen yksilöllisyys, eli se biologinen erityisyys tai biologiset tekijät, jokainen lapsi on hyvin erilainen ja yksilöllinen ja lapsen yksilölliset piirteet vaikuttaa siihen, miten ne ympäristötekijät lapseen vaikuttaa.

Pahoittelut siitä. Ihan lyhyesti näistä peruselementeistä, mitä tapahtuu siinä varhaisessa vuorovaikutussuhteessa. Ensimmäinen on tämä kiintymyssuhteen rakentuminen, eli siinä ensimmäisen vuoden aikana lapselle rakentuu perusturvallisuuden tunne suhteessa niihin vuorovaikutuskokemuksiin mitä hän on siinä ensimmäisen vuoden aikana saanut. ja tästä kokemusmaailmasta syntyy sellainen pysyvä tyyli tai kokemus, puhutaan kiintymyssuhdetyylistä, joka aktivoituu erilaisissa stressi- ja kriisitilanteissa. Se malli joka siinä aktivoituu kuvaa sitä, että miten rauhoitan ja lohdutan itseäni, kun koen oloni turvattomaksi. Tuija Turunen on muistaakseni Psykopodiaa-podcastissa hyvin kuvannut, että ’’turvallinen kiintymyssuhde on kuin rokote joka suojaa kriisitilanteissa.’’ Eli jos lapsi on saanut kokemuksen varhaisessa vaiheessa, että hänen tarpeisiinsa vastataan ja hän saa lohtua ja säätelyä aikuiselta riittävällä tavalla, niin hänelle lähtee rakentumaan turvallinen kiintymyssuhde joka auttaa häntä kriisin ja hädän hetkellä.\n\nMutta sitten sellainen toinen keskeinen elementti, joka on vähän eriasia ja laajempi on sitten lapsen itsesäätelyn kapasiteetti joka lähtee rakentumaan siinä varhaise",

Ja sillä lapsen itsesäätelyllä kuvataan lapsen kykyä säädellä itseään, omia tunteita ja toimintaa tilanteiden vaatimusten mukaan. Tunnesäätely on tällaista ajatusten ja käyttäytymisen ja tunteiden joustavaa säätelyä. Ja tämä on sellainen tosi monitahoinen prosessi kun se lähtee kehittymään, ja sillä on tosi vahvasti biologinen perusta ja se perustuu meidän temperamenttiin.

Mutta sitten mun mielestä nykypäivänä on hirveän tärkeä puhua siitä että mikään vanhemmuus tai vuorovaikutus ei ole täydellistä ja sen ei myöskään kuulu olla täydellistä. Että joskus nykymaailmassa saatetaan antaa jotenkin kuva, että vanhemmuus olisi joku tällainen suorituslaji ja että pitäisi tarjota vain tällaista harmonista ja pelkkää hyvää, turvallista meininkiä, mutta niin se ei missään nimessä ole, että kyllä jokaiseen vuorovaikutussuhteeseen kuuluu myös niitä katkoksia, lapsen aloitteiden ohittamista ja hankalia tunteita, niin ne on myös tärkeitä lapsen itsesäätelyn kehityksen kannalta, että lapsi saa kokemuksia oman säätelyn rajoista ja kokemuksen yhteyden korjaantumisesta. Mutta asiakastyössä mielestäni olennaista on löytää ne krooniset ja voimakkaat stressitekijät, ja erityisesti niistä pitää olla huolissaan jos sieltä ei löydy sellaisia suojaavia tekijöitä.\n\nSitten muistutan nopeasti tällaisella englanninkielisellä dialla, että nyt sellainen tutkimuksessa vähän uusi ympäristötekijä, minkä me helposti unohdamme on tietenkin nämä digilaitteet, että meillä on ihan selkeä osoitus siitä, että pienten lasten merkittävä digilaitteiden käyttö, siis useamman tunnin käyttö päivässä on riski lapsen kehitykselle.

Ja myös myöhemmän kehityksen vaiheet on merkityksellisiä myös itsesäätely, kiintymyssuhde ja kielikehitys jatkuu pikkulapsivaiheen jälkeen. Ja sitten pikkulapsivaiheen jälkeen tulee ihan uusia kehityksellisiä alueita, kuten ongelmanratkaisukyky, muistitoiminnot, tunteiden tunnistaminen ja nimeäminen ynnä muu. Samanaikaisesti lapsen itsenäisyys kasvaa ja ympäristö laajenee, tulee varhaiskasvatus, koulu, kaverit ja digimaailma. Ja on tärkeää muistaa että kaikilla näillä on vaikutusta, että myös näissä kohdissa lapsen kehitys voi lähteä tosi suotuisaan suuntaan tai sitten johonkin huolestuttavaan ja haitalliseen suuntaan. Että jos me halutaan ymmärtää lapsen kokonaisvaltaista kehitystä mielenterveyttä ja oppimista, niin meillä pitää olla joka vaiheesta kiinnostuneita, vaikka aivojen kehityksen kannalta tämä pikkulapsivaihe ja nuoruusikä on ne kaikkein kriittisimmät.\n\nTässä meidän tutkimuksessa meitä kiinnostaa tällaiset pitkittäiset kehitykselliset rajektorit ihan sinne nuoruusikään asti.

Ja tarvitaan tukea vanhemmuuteen ja lapsen ja vanhemman väliseen suhteen rakentumiseen, mutta me tarvitaan ihan myös vanhempien mielenterveysoireiden hoitoa ja arjen hallinnan apua ja tukea terveydestä laajemminkin huolehtimiseen.

Ryhmän sisältöjen toteutuksessa huomioidaan lasten toiveet ja kokeillaan heitä kiinnostavia asioita.

Tänä vuonna raportissa on ensimmäistä kertaa tietoa järjestöjen toiminnan kokonaisbudjetista sekä lastensuojelun avo-, sijais- ja jälkihuollon osuudesta siinä. Näiden tietojen vertailukohtana raportista löytyy muutamien isoimpien kuntien vastaavia tunnuslukutietoja.\n\nTunnuslukuraporttia käytetään laajasti vaikuttamistyön tukena esimerkiksi kunta-, kansanedustaja- ja yliopistoyhteistyössä. Siitä onkin muodostunut VSLJ:n keskeisin vaikuttamistyön työkalu, joka on myös jäsenjärjestöjen vapaassa käytössä.\n\n## Raportti havainnollistaa lastensuojelujärjestöjen merkittävyyden\n\nVuoden 2021 tunnuslukuraportista näkyy selkeästi Varsinais-Suomessa toimivien lastensuojelujärjestöjen laajan toimintapotentiaali.

Perhelinjassa tavoitteemme on ollut saada lastensuojelujärjestöjen tarjoamaa tukea Varsinais-Suomessa lapsiperheiden saataville sinne, missä sitä ei ole aikaisemmin ollut saatavilla. Hankkeen aikana palveluja on tuotu lähelle perheitä niin palveluohjausbussilla kuin etäyhteyksin.\n\n## Vuosi 2021\n\nVuonna 2021 Perhelinjassa painopisteemme oli yksikö- ja perhetyön vastaanottotyössä, jonka kautta lapsiperheet saivat järjestöjen ammattilaisten antamaa keskusteluapua, neuvontaa ja ohjausta eri arjen haasteisiin. Vastaanottotyön asiakastapaamisten määrä kasvoi vuodesta 2020 n. 70 % tavoittaen asiakkaita 192 kertaa. Apua haettiin erityisesti lähisuhdeväkivallan, vanhemmuuden ja mielenterveys- ja päihdeomaisten tuen teemoihin liittyen. Yhteydenottoja oli 15:sta eri Varsinais-Suomen kunnasta.\n\nVuoden aikana järjestimme myös verkkoluentosarjan, joka tavoitti yhteensä 372 osallistujaa. Luennot käsittelivät mm. mielenterveys- ja päihdeomaisiin, parisuhteen kriiseihin, nuorten kokemaan seksuaaliseen häirintään ja vanhempien eroon liittyviä teemoja. Ammattilaisille järjestimme 10 etänä toteutettua infoa Perhelinjan palveluista. Infoihin osallistui ammattilaisia yhteensä 21:stä eri Varsinais-Suomen kunnasta.

Perhelinja jatkaa kuitenkin vuonna 2022 yksilö- ja perhetyön vastaanottotyötä siirtyneellä avustuksella, ja toistaiseksi Perhelinjan verkkosivut säilyvät VSLJ:ssä järjestöjen tukea kokoavana paikkana.\n\nPerhelinjan koordinaatio ja esimerkiksi keskitetty palveluneuvonta järjestöjen palveluista tulee päättymään vuoden aikana, mutta järjestöt ovat jatkossakin lapsiperheiden tukena, ja esimerkiksi digipalvelut mahdollistavat koko Varsinais-Suomen alueella tarjottua tukea entistä paremmin.\n\n## Kehittämistyön juurtumista\n\nPerhelinjan merkitys VSLJ:lle ja järjestöille itselleen on ollut erityisesti järjestöjen välisen konkreettisen yhteistyön tiivistäminen.

Perhelinja on kuitenkin omalta osaltaan luonut pohjaa sille, että toimimme järjestöinä yhdessä meneillään olevassa sote-uudistuksessa.

Näin 100-vuotiaan itsenäisen Suomen juhlavuotena on hyvä pohtia, miten lasten yhdenvertaisuus ja käänteisesti eriarvoisuus on näkynyt maamme historiassa. Blogissa julkaistaan nyt neljän viikon aikana artikkelisarja, jossa erilaisten teemojen kautta syvennytään lasten yhdenvertaisuuden kehittymiseen Suomessa. Artikkelisarjan teemoja on valikoitu lasten hyvinvoinnin indikaattoreiden pohjalta. Lapsivaltuutetun toimisto määritteli valtioneuvoston politiikkaohjelman tuella kansalliset lasten hyvinvoinnin indikaattorit vuosien 2007–2011 aikana. Indikaattorit ovat: materiaalinen elintaso, kasvuympäristön turvallisuus, terveys, koulu ja oppiminen, perhe, vapaa-aika ja osallisuus sekä valtion ja kuntien tarjoama tuki ja suojelu.\n\n## Lapsella on oikeus hyvään elämään\n\nYksi merkittävimmistä lasten eriarvoisuutta aiheuttavista tekijöistä on lapsen ja perheen köyhyys. Aihe on ollut Suomessa vilkkaan keskustelun alla koko 2000-luvun ajan. YK:n Lapsen oikeuksien sopimuksen mukaisesti lapsella on oikeus hyvään elämään ja riittävään elintasoon. Vuonna 2015 YK asetti Kestävän kehityksen tavoitteet, joista yksi on poistaa köyhyys kaikissa muodoissaan kaikkialta maailmasta vuoteen 2030 mennessä.

Lapsiköyhyyskysymyksiin sisältyy erityisiä eettisiä ja moraalisia ulottuvuuksia, sillä lapsi on täysin riippuvainen kasvuympäristöstään eikä ole itse vastuussa omasta sosiaalisesta tai taloudellisesta huono-osaisuudestaan.\n\nKöyhyys on yhteiskunnallinen ilmiö, johon liittyy monenlaisia ulottuvuuksia ja sitä voidaan mitata erilaisilla mittareilla ja indikaattoreilla. Puhutaan sekä absoluuttisesta että suhteellisesta köyhyydestä. Tilasta, jossa vaatetuksen, ravinnon ja asumisen vähimmäisedellytyksen eivät täyty, puhutaan absoluuttisena köyhyytenä. Suhteellisessa köyhyydessä yksilön tai ryhmän tulo- ja elintasoa verrataan yhteiskunnan yleiseen tulo- ja elintasoon. Suhteellisesti köyhät joutuvat siis kamppailemaan, jotta pystyvät elämään normaalia elämää ja päästäkseen osallisiksi yhteiskunnan sosiaalisiin, taloudellisiin ja kulttuurisiin toimintoihin.\n\nYksi perinteinen köyhyyden mittari tutkimuksissa on ollut tulojen riittävyyden arvioiminen, mutta lasten asemaa se ei mittaa riittävän kattavasti, sillä köyhyys voi olla muunkin kuin rahan puutetta. Lisäksi vanhempien tulotason mittauksessa oletetaan, että perheessä kaikki jakavat saman elintason, mikä joissakin tapauksissa voi aliarvioida lapsen todellista elintasoa. Köyhyyden määrittelyssä ja mittaamisessa tulee tulojen riittävyyden ja aineellisen puutteen lisäksi pystyä mittaa",

Köyhyyden määrittelyssä ja mittaamisessa tulee tulojen riittävyyden ja aineellisen puutteen lisäksi pystyä mittaamaan ja arvioimaan myös toimintakykyä ja toimintavalmiutta sekä sosiaalista ulkopuolisuutta. Köyhyys voi siis tarkoittaa riittämättömien tulojen tai aineellisen puutteen lisäksi toimintakyvyn tai toimintavalmiuden puutetta sekä sosiaalista ulkopuolisuutta.\n\nKöyhyys voi olla elämäntilanteesta riippuen hetkellistä ja ohimenevää. Toisaalta se voi olla pitkäaikaista, pysyvää tai periytyvää. Toisinaan köyhyys on näkyvää ja avointa, mutta usein myös piiloon ja näkymättömäksi jäävää. Vahvat mielikuvat ja tunteet, kuten häpeä ja toivottomuus, kietoutuvat ilmiön ympärille. Historiassa Suomea leimasi pitkään mielikuva takapajuisesta maasta, missä köyhyys kosketti kaikkia kaikkialla. Voidaankin puhua kansakunnan kollektiivisesta kokemuksesta, sillä köyhyys ulottui niin laajalle, että sen ulko- tai sisäpuolelle ei erityisesti rajautunut kukaan. Lapset eivät elä yhteiskunnasta erillään. Näin ollen yhteiskunnassa tapahtuva yhdenvertaistuminen tai eriarvoistuminen muokkaa lapsuutta, lapsen elämää ja lapsen kokemuksia.\n\n## Köyhäinhoidosta hyvinvointiyhteiskunnaksi\n\nLapset ja lapsiperheet ovat keskeinen sosiaalipolitiikan kohderyhmä, joten seuraavaksi tarkastelen lapsiköyhyyttä hyvinvointipolitiikan kehityksen historian kautta.

Suomalaisen hyvinvointipolitiikan juuret ulottuvat syvälle historiaan, Ruotsin vallan aikaan. Yhteiskunnallisen tuen puuttuessa vähäosaisista huolehtiminen oli täysin sukulaisten ja perheiden harteilla. Harteiden pettäessä, ihmiset jäivät oman onnensa nojaan. Kulkutaudit, kerjuu ja rikollisuus vauhdittivat 1500- ja 1600-luvuilla maakuntalakien säätämistä, joiden myötä sukulaisten rooli köyhien huoltajina hiljalleen vähentyi. Lainsäädännön lisäksi myös 1100-luvulta lähtien Suomessa vaikuttanut kristinusko vähensi suvun merkitystä köyhien huollossa, kun kirkolle maksettavista kymmenysveroista varattiin tietty osa köyhien avustamiseen. 1500-lukua voidaan pitää Euroopassa modernin sosiaalipolitiikan syntykautena. Se tarkoitti kokonaisvaltaista aatteellista, valtiollis-poliittista ja taloudellista kehitystä, mikä on jatkunut 2000-luvulle asti.\n\nSosiaaliset kysymykset nousivat keskustelun alle usein erilaisten kriisien myötä. Yksi tällainen oli Euroopassa koettu viimeinen nälänhätä 1860-luvulla. Nälkä tappoi massoittain ihmisiä myös Suomessa ja vuoden 1868 kevääseen mennessä kuolleisuus oli viisinkertaistunut kriisiä edeltäneeseen aikaan verrattuna. Suomen väestöstä menetettiin vuosien 1866–1868 välisenä aikana yhdeksän prosenttia ja kriisi kosketti erityisen raskaasti imeväisiä, vanhuksia sekä maaseudun työläisiä.

Samanlaista absoluuttista köyhyyttä ja nälkäkuolemia ei Euroopassa ole tämän katastrofin jälkeen koettu.\n\nVuoden 1918 sotaa edelsi ajanjakso, jolloin teollistumisen tuottama vaurastuminen kasvatti taloudellista eriarvoisuutta, ja kansainvälisesti käyty keskustelu köyhyyden lieveilmiöinä syntyneistä sosiaalisista ongelmista saavutti myös Suomen. Tilattoman väestön asemaan ja vaivaisten huutokauppaan kohdistuva kritiikki myös kasvoi. Vuonna 1918 käyty sota jakoi kansan ja jätti jälkeensä raskaat tappiot; 3 000 kaatunutta sekä 1 600 murhattua valkoista ja 800 murhattua punaista. Lisäksi sodan jälkeen 8 400 punavankia teloitettiin ja 12 000 punavankia kuoli vankileireillä. Raskaat menetykset tarkoittivat sitä, että yli 14 000 lasta ja 5 000 perhettä jäivät puutteellisen toimeentulon varaan.

Suomalaisten ajattelu muuttui yhteisvastuuta, oikeudenmukaisuutta ja sosiaalista turvallisuutta korostavaksi. Kansan eheyttäminen oli ideologinen perusta sosiaaliturvajärjestelmän kehittämiselle, jonka taas mahdollisti sotia seurannut talouskasvu. Muodostui maaperä hyvinvointivaltion luomiselle, eli sosiaaliturvakoneistolle, joka turvaa kansalaisille universaalin vähimmäiselintason.\n\nPyrkimys kansalliseen eheyteen, sisäpoliittinen suunnan muutos sekä yhtenäistyvä ammattiyhdistysliike siivittivät Suomen tulopolitiikan aikakauteen. Pohjoismaisille hyvinvointivaltioille tyypillinen palveluihin perustuva sosiaalipolitiikka alkoi saamaan sijaa Suomessa, mikä ilmentyi esimerkiksi päivähoidon kehittämisessä. Taustalla vaikutti voimakkaasti näkemys, jonka mukaan köyhienhoito tulee korvata ajatuksella siitä, että palvelut luodaan kaikille niitä tarvitseville, ei vain kaikkein vähäosaisimmille. Näin ollen vuonna 1973 ensimmäisenä sosiaalipalveluiden uudistuksena toteutettiin päivähoitouudistus, jonka myötä päivähoito irrotettiin lastensuojelusta ja määriteltiin yleiseksi sosiaalipalveluksi.

Tähän vaikuttivat merkittävästi läntisen talouden taantuminen, hiipunut neuvostokauppa sekä 1980-luvun lopussa harjoitettu raha- ja valuuttapolitiikka. Talouskriisin aikana tehtiin rajuja säästöjä, tehostamisia ja leikkauksia palveluihin, myös lasten ja nuorten palveluihin. Hyvinvointivaltioajattelussa keskeistä on, että kaikilla on tasa-arvoinen mahdollisuus, taloudellisesta asemasta riippumatta, hyvätasoisiin ja kohtuuhintaisiin peruspalveluihin. 1990-luvun lama nakersi vakaata hyvinvointivaltiota, sillä sen seurauksena monet palvelut kaventuivat sekä vähenivät ja kuntien välinen eriarvoisuus palveluiden määrän ja laadun suhteen kasvoi.\n\n1960-luvulta alkanut lapsiköyhyyden vähentyminen kääntyi nousuun vuonna 1995 ja lapsiköyhyysaste saavutti huippunsa vuonna 2007. Tätä selittää se, että vuosien 1995–2007 välisenä aikana Suomessa tuloerojen kasvu oli OECD-maiden korkeinta. Tuloerojen kasvua selittää erityisesti kaikkein eniten tienaavien ja muiden tulonsaajien välisen kuilun leventyminen, jolloin tulojaon yläpäässä eriarvoisuuden kasvaminen on ollut kaikkein nopeinta.

Vuosina 1995–2007 köyhyysaste kaksinkertaistui koko väestössä ja lähes kominkertaistui lapsiväestössä.\n\n## Lapsiköyhyyskysymyksiä ei ole saatu ratkaistua\n\nVuoden 2007 jälkeen lapsiköyhyys laski, mutta kääntyi jälleen nousuun vuonna 2012. Terveyden ja hyvinvoinnin laitoksen (THL) mukaan vuonna 2014 Suomessa oli yli 100 000 köyhää lasta ja samanlainen kehitys on nähtävissä lapsiperheiden kohdalla. Erityisesti köyhyyden kasvu on viime vuosien aikana koskettanut pikkulapsiperheitä, joissa kaikki lapset ovat alle kouluikäisiä. EU-maiden lapsiköyhyyttä selvittänyt raportti osoittaa, että suurin lapsiköyhyysriski on pienillä, alle 3-vuotiailla lapsilla sekä nuorilla, 12–17-vuotiailla lapsilla. Lisäksi lapsiköyhyys on suurimmalla osalla pitkäaikainen tila; 64 % tuloköyhistä lapsista vuonna 2006 oli ollut tuloköyhä myös vähintään kahtena vuotena edeltäneen kolmen vuoden aikana.\n\nTHL:n mukaan lapsiperheiden köyhyyden taustalla vaikuttavat erityisesti vanhempien työttömyys, matala koulutus sekä yleinen työelämässä tapahtunut muutos. Tilastojen mukaan noin puolet köyhien lapsiperheiden huoltajista on työssä, mutta he ovat muiden lapsiperheiden huoltajia useammin pätkätöissä sekä osa-aikaisissa ja matalapalkkaisissa töissä.

Osittain tätä voidaan selittää sillä, että köyhien lapsiperheiden huoltajilla on verrattain matala koulutustaso ja reilulla neljänneksellä ei ole perusastetta korkeampaa koulutusta. Koulutus yksin ei kuitenkaan suojaa köyhyydeltä, sillä noin viidenneksellä köyhien lapsiperheiden huoltajista on korkeakoulututkinto. Lapsiperheköyhyyden merkittäviä taustatekijöitä ovat myös yksinhuoltajuus sekä vanhemman työkyvyttömyys.\n\nTutkimuksissa on selvinnyt, että ylisukupolvinen huono-osaisuus ei selity ainoastaan vanhempien tuloköyhyydellä, vaan taustalla vaikuttaa merkittävästi huono-osaisuuden kasautuminen, eli pitkäaikainen toimeentulotuen asiakkuus, työttömyys sekä matala koulutus. Näin ollen hyvinvointivaltion tarjoamat ilmainen koulutus ja laaja sosiaaliturva eivät onnistu kompensoimaan sosiaalisia tekijöitä, joiden seurauksena sosiaalinen asema periytyy sukupolvelta toiselle. Professori Juho Saari puhuu ryhmistä, jotka eivät pääse yhteiskunnassa mukaan myönteiseen kehitykseen, jolloin he jäävät tavanomaisen elämäntason, elämäntavan ja elämänlaadun ulkopuolelle.\n\nLasten arjessa taloudellinen eriarvoisuus näyttäytyy sekä materiaalisena että tunnetasolla.

Näin ollen lapsen kokemukseen ei vaikuta ainoastaan vanhempien tulotaso vaan myös ympäristö, johon omaa taloudellista tilannetta ja kulutusresursseja verrataan. Taloudellinen eriarvoisuus määrittää lasten toimintamahdollisuuksia esimerkiksi vapaa-ajan tai harrastusten suhteen, jolloin ulkopuolelle jääminen vaikuttaa lasten yhteenkuuluvuuden tunteisiin.\n\nMainitsin aiemmin, että köyhyyteen liittyy vahvoja tunteita ja mielikuvia. Köyhyyteen liittyvä yhteiskunnallinen stigma tulee esille myös lasten keskuudessa. Taloudelliseen asemaan assosioidaan erilaisia piirteitä, kuten köyhiin lapsiin nöyryys ja passiivisuus, varakkaisiin lapsiin taas ulospäinsuuntautuneisuus, vahva itsetunto, itsekkyys ja jopa ilkeys. Lasten taloudellisen eriarvoisuuden kokemuksissa keskiöön nousevat sosiaalisten vertaissuhteiden muodostaminen ja ylläpito; on helpompi solmia ja syventää kaverisuhde samassa taloudellisessa tilanteessa olevan lapsen kanssa.

Köyhyys on yksi merkittävimmistä eriarvoisuutta aiheuttavista tekijöistä lapsille, minkä takia Suomen ja päätöksentekijöiden tulee ottaa ilmiö vakavasti. Kaikessa poliittisessa päätöksenteossa tulisi aktiivisesti arvioida lapsivaikutuksia ja erityisesti pitää mielessä köyhien lasten ahdinko. Historia osoittaa, että lapsiin panostava sosiaalipolitiikka on pitkällä aikavälillä yksi hyvinvointivaltion peruspilari. 100-vuotiaassa Suomessa olisikin syytä pohtia, miten tämä peruspilari pidetään tulevaisuudessakin vakaasti pystyssä.

Järjestöt raportoivat hyvin moninaisia havaintoja, mutta huoli perheiden jaksamisesta pitkään jatkuneessa poikkeustilanteessa näkyi kaikissa vastauksissa. Alla poimintoja järjestöjen havainnoista. Järjestöjen havainnot toimitettiin kokonaisuudessaan Turun kaupunginhallituksen tietoon.\n\n## Lapsiperheiden taloudellinen tilanne heikentynyt selvästi viime vuodesta\n\nHope ry:ssä asiakasmäärä on kasvanut merkittävästi ja uusia asiakkaita tulee jatkuvasti lisää. Hope ry jakaa vähävaraisille perheille vaate- ja tavaralahjoituksia sekä lapsille ja nuorille harrastustukea ja vapaa-ajan elämyksiä. Tämän vuoden aikana asiakkaana on ollut Turussa jo 400 perhettä, kun viime vuoden keväänä vastaava luku oli 270.\n\nMonet perheet sinnittelevät pitkään ennen avun pyytämistä. Perheet saattavat esimerkiksi odottaa toimeentulotukipäätöstä, ja rahat loppuvatkin kesken ennen kuin myönteinen päätös saadaan. Hope ry:llä on erityinen huoli nuorten tilanteesta perheissä, joissa taloudellinen tilanne jatkuu pitkään heikkona.\n\n## Ongelmat kärjistyvät perheissä, joissa jo ennestään vaikeuksia\n\nPerheet ovat olleet vuoden aikana korona",

Järjestöjen havaintojen mukaan perheiden eriytyneisyys näkyy entistä selvemmin. On perheitä, joissa lisääntynyt yhteinen aika on parantanut perheen välisiä suhteita, jos perhesuhteet ovat olleet hyvät lähtökohtaisestikin. Samaan aikaan on entistä väsyneempiä vanhempia, joiden on vaikea nähdä hyvää lapsissaan. Pahimmassa tapauksessa lapset ovat joko pahoinvoinnin kohteena tai joutuvat seuraamaan sivusta esimerkiksi väkivaltaa muiden perheenjäsenten välillä.\n\nPerheiden, joissa on mielenterveys- tai päihdeongelmia, tilanne on edelleen heikentynyt. Etäpalvelut eivät tue kaikkia mielenterveyskuntoutujia ja hoitoon tai avokuntoutukseen pääsy on ollut vuoden aikana hyvin vaikeaa. Tilanteen kuormittavuus näkyy omaisten, perheiden ja sisarusten hyvinvoinnissa.\n\nNiissä uusperheissä, joissa suhteissa on ollut hankauksia jo ennestään, korona on kärjistänyt välejä entisestään. Jos välit ex-kumppaniin ovat lähtökohtaisesti tulehtuneet, on korona antanut mahdollisuuden vaikeuttaa lasten tapaamisia etävanhemman kanssa. Yhden vanhemman perheissä huolena ovat puolestaan pienet sosiaaliset verkostot, oma tai lasten sairastuminen ja käytännön asioista huolehtiminen korona-arjessa.\n\n## Palvelujen tarve kasvanut, mut",

Esimerkiksi Turun Ensi- ja turvakoti ry:ssä asiakkaat ohjautuvat hyvin myöhäisessä vaiheessa ensikotiin tai avopalveluun. Tilanne on selkeästi muuttunut viime keväästä. Viimeisen vuoden aikana (3/20–3/21) ensikotiin ohjautui vain kolme raskaana olevaa äitiä.

Raportoija toimii asiakkaan äänenä, ja raportointi on keino siirtää tietoa päättäjille ja toiminnan kehittäjille.\n\nSosiaaliset ilmiöt ovat usein monitahoisia, ja tilastot voivat antaa niistä yksioikoisen kuvan. Sosiaalinen raportointi tuottaa tietoa, joka auttaa näkemään tilastojen taakse ja ymmärtämään monimutkaisia ilmiöitä syvemmin. Sosiaalinen raportointi voi myös tuoda esiin aivan uusia asioita - nousevia ilmiöitä, joita ei tilastoista löydä, ja hiljaisia signaaleja, joihin olisi syytä reagoida nopeasti ennen kuin ne suuriksi huoliksi ehtivät kasvaakaan.\n\n## Lastensuojelun sosiaalisen raportoinnin kokeilu Varsinais-Suomessa\n\nSosiaalisen raportoinnin käytännön toteutuksesta on erilaisia variaatioita. Varsinais-Suomen sosiaalialan osaamiskeskus VASSOn sivuilla on mahdollista vastata sosiaalisen raportoinnin kyselyyn. Aikuissosiaalityössä kyselyä on käytetty jo aiemmin, mutta lastensuojelussa kyselyä kokeiltiin keväällä ensimmäisen kerran yhteistyössä Varsinais-Suomen Lastensuojelujärjestöjen kanssa. Vastauksia kerättiin niin julkisen sektorin kuin järjestöjen työntekijöiltä ja vapaaehtoisilta. Raportit on nyt julkaistu. Vastaajia oli tässä ensimmäisessä kokeilussa vähän, joten vahvoja johtopäätöksiä lasten, nuorten ja lapsiperheiden tilanteista ei raportin perusteella voida tehdä.

Meillä oli 80 alakoululaista vuoden aikana. Heidän kanssaan tuli vietettyä aikaa lähemmäs 600 tuntia joko perheiden kotona tai toimistollamme Perhetalo Heidekenillä. Tämä lisäksi pidimme tiiviisti yhteyttä perheisiin ja heidän verkostoihinsa (yli 700 viestiä/puhelua vuoden aikana). Osallistuimme myös yhdessä perheiden kanssa lähes 200 eri verkostopalaveriin muun muassa sosiaalitoimessa, lastenpsykiatrialla ja kouluissa. Asiakkaita meillä oli jokaiselta vuosiluokalta, mutta eniten asiakkaina oli 5. luokkalaisia, tasapuolisesti tyttöjä ja poikia. Ruotsin kieltä äidinkielenään puhuvien osuus oli huikeat 23 % kaikista asiakkaista.\n\n## Vanhempien ymmärrys lapsen koulunkäynnin haasteiden juurisyistä lisääntyi – myös lapsilta kiitettävää palautetta\n\nKeräsimme asiakkailtamme suoraa palautetta ja iloksemme saimme todeta, että 98 % vanhemmista koki saaneensa Kotoa kouluun -toiminnan kautta apua ja tukea tilanteeseensa. Vanhempien ymmärrys lapsen koulunkäynnin haasteiden juurisyistä lisääntyi ja he kokivat, että lapsen hyvinvointi lisääntyi selvästi. Myös lapsilta tuli kiitettävää palautetta. Suurin osa arvioi saaneensa apua ja totesi, että heitä oli kuunneltu ja että heitä ymmärretään nyt paremmin.\n\nLisäksi teetimme asiakkuuden alkaessa ja loppuessa vanhemmilla Oppimis- ja ",

Yhteenvetona tuloksista voimme todeta, että koulunkäyntikyky oli vahvistunut 78 %:lla lapsista ja 66 %:lla muutos oli merkittävä.\n\nLapset ovat myös itse sanoittaneet syitä koulunkäynnin vaikeuksille:\n\nKeväällä 2024 järjestimme yhden vertaistukiryhmän asiakasäideille. Vanhempien pyynnöstä yhdistimme syksyllä kaksi aikaisempaa vertaistukiryhmää yhdeksi isoksi ryhmäksi. Tapaamisia oli kahdeksan syksyn aikana. Keväällä järjestimme myös Cool kids -ryhmän yhteistyössä Varhan kanssa. Siihen osallistui viisi lasta yhden vanhempansa kanssa.\n\nKaiken kerätyn tiedon ja palautteen ansiosta voimme kiteyttää vuoden 2024 yhteen virkkeeseen: Kotoa kouluun -toiminta on kustannustehokas ja vaikuttava järjestöpohjainen toimintamalli, jonka hyödyt ovat nähtävissä niin asiakasvanhempien voimaantumisessa, lasten minäpystyvyyden lisääntymisessä kuin hienossa moniammatillisessa yhteistyössä koko Turun alueella.\n\n## Lisätietoja\n\nKotoa kouluun -toiminnan perhevalmentajat\n\nJaa artikkeli:",

Koostimme viisi ajankohtaista asiaa, jotka tulisi ottaa huomioon päätöksenteossa niin hyvinvointialueella kuin kunnissa. Näillä keinoilla voidaan tutkitusti parantaa ihmisten hyvinvointia ja tuottaa pitkällä tähtäimellä myös säästöjä.\n\n## 1. Peruspalveluiden saatavuuteen panostamalla ehkäistään pahoinvointia\n\nTutkimuksissa on tunnistettu, että palveluiden ja niiden saatavuudella ja saavutettavuudella on merkitystä asuinalueen asukkaiden hyvinvoinnille palveluiden käyttöasteesta riippumatta. Tämä tarkoittaa sitä, että jo palvelun hyödyntämisen mahdollisuus lisää hyvinvointia.\n\nVertailtaessa erilaisia alueita keskenään palveluiden lisäksi jo pelkkä julkisten tilojen tai puistojen olemassaolo parantaa asukkaiden hyvinvointia riippumatta siitä, minkä verran näitä hyödynnetään. Asuinalueen palveluiden merkitys on tunnistettu hyvinvoinnille erityisesti lapsiperheissä ja ikäihmisten keskuudessa. Tutkimusten mukaan ne voivat kompensoida yksilön tai kotitalouden resurssien riittämättömyyttä, jolloin niillä on ollut köyhyyskokemuksia lieventävä vaikutus.\n\nTutkimusten mukaan palveluiden karsiminen ei ainoastaan vaikuta heikentävästi hyvinvoinnin kokemuksiin, vaan voi myös lisätä nuorten häiriökäyttäytymistä.

Tutkimuksissa on saatu esimerkiksi viitteitä siitä, että palvelujen ja viheralueiden saatavuus ja saavutettavuus voivat lisätä perheiden hyvinvointia ja ehkäistä lasten kaltoinkohtelua ja sijaishuollon tarvetta. Tämän perusteella lähipalveluiden supistaminen saattaa siis siirtää kuluja palveluiden tuottamisesta häiriökäyttäytymisestä ja pahoinvoinnista aiheutuviin suoriin ja epäsuoriin aineellisiin ja henkisiin kustannuksiin.​\n\n## 2. Suhdeperustaisuudella voidaan lisätä työn vaikuttavuutta\n\nTutkimusten mukaan asiakkaan ja työntekijän yhteistyösuhde on työn tuloksellisuuden kannalta keskeinen tekijä. Yhteistyösuhde on merkityksellinen niin sosiaali- ja terveysalan palveluissa kuin esimerkiksi kasvatusalalla opettajan ja oppilaan välillä.\n\nTyöntekijän ja asiakkaan välisen suhteen on tutkimuksissa havaittu olevan sidottu samanaikaisesti sekä ammatillisen että läheisen ihmissuhteen normeihin. Käytännössä suhde työntekijään vaikuttaa asiakkaan hyvinvointiin monin eri ja toisiinsa kietoutuvin tavoin, mutta siitä huolimatta asiakaskokemusten mukaan muutoksia tulee usein, äkillisesti ja ne ovat huonosti käsiteltyjä.

Näin ollen suhdeperustaisuuden eli asiakkaan ja työntekijän välisen vuorovaikutuksen ja luottamuksen hyödyntäminen edellyttää asiakaslähtöisistä tarpeista lähtöisin olevia tukisuhteita, työntekijöiden pysyvyyden vahvistamista sekä palveluprosesseista epätarkoituksenmukaisten katkosten karsimista.​\n\n## 3. Nuorten mielenterveyttä vahvistetaan lisäämällä toivoa ja tukea\n\nTutkimusten mukaan joka viides lapsista ja nuorista maailmanlaajuisesti kokee mielenterveyden haasteita. Lasten ja nuorten mielenterveyden yksilöllisten haasteiden lisäksi keskeisessä osassa ovat yhteiskunnallisina tekijöinä suorituspaineet, ilmastonmuutos, sosioekonomiset haasteet, kiusaaminen ja sen laajentuminen myös sosiaaliseen mediaan.\n\nTutkimusten perusteella olisi tärkeää erottaa mielenterveyshäiriöt ja reagointi esimerkiksi ympäristöhaasteisiin, kiusaamiseen tai suorituspaineisiin toisistaan. Näistä ensimmäinen vaatii terveydenhoitoa ja jälkimmäinen yhteiskunnallisia toimia.

Mikäli tulevaisuudesta tulee näköalatonta, siitä tulee samalla ahdistavaa.​ Toivoa voidaan luoda esimerkiksi lisäämällä nuorten koulutus- ja työllistymismahdollisuuksia, huomioimalla päätöksenteossa ilmastonäkökulma, kiusaamiseen puuttumalla sekä poistamalla eriarvoisuuden luomia esteitä unelmien saavuttamiselle.\n\n## 4. Koulun aikuisten työhyvinvoinnilla vaikutetaan oppilaiden hyvinvointiin\n\nTutkimuksissa kouluissa on tunnistettu sekä hyvinvoinnin suojaavia että riskitekijöitä. Myönteiseksi on tunnistettu luokkatyörauha, liikuntamahdollisuudet, tukioppilastoiminta sekä viheralueet. Tutkimusten mukaan erityisesti kouluilmapiirillä ja luodulla koulukulttuurilla on tärkeä merkitys sekä opettajien työhyvinvoinnille että oppilaiden hyvinvoinnille.\n\nOpettajien hyvinvointia parantamalla voidaan tutkimusten mukaan parantaa myös oppilaiden hyvinvointia.

Kouluhyvinvointi on merkittävässä osassa myös oppimisessa, sillä se vaikuttaa oppilaiden motivaatioon ja tutkimusten mukaan jopa esimerkiksi lukutaitoon. Vaikutus kestää vuosia eteenpäin ja tukee parhaimmillaan esimerkiksi peruskoulun jälkeen toisen asteen opintojen läpäisyä.\n\nTutkimuksissa on tunnistettu, että koulun pieni koko on yhteydessä kokemukseen kouluun kuulumisesta ja tämän vuoksi esimerkiksi väkivaltaa esiintyy vähemmän pienissä kouluissa. Lisäksi tutkimusten mukaan pieni koulu voi kuulumisen kokemuksen myötä kannatella lapsen ja nuoren mielen hyvinvointia, mitä vaikutusta suuremmalla koululla ei samalla tavalla ole. Vaikka oppimisen kannalta keskustellaan ensisijaisesti luokkakoosta, on koulun koko merkityksellinen oppilaiden hyvinvoinnin osalta.\n\n## 5.

Long covid aiheuttaa fyysisiä, psyykkisiä tai neurologisia ongelmia, jotka ilmenevät väsymyksenä, hengitysvaikeuksina, päänsärkyinä, lihaskipuna, suolisto-oireina ja kognitiivisina vaikeuksina. Lisäksi osaksi long covidia on tunnistettu psyykkisinä oireina ahdistusta, masennusta, mielialan vaihteluita ja ärtyneisyyttä. Nämä haasteet voivat johtaa mm. koulupoissaoloihin, työpoissaoloihin ja sosiaaliseen vetäytymiseen.\n\nKansainvälisissä tutkimuksissa yhdeksi tärkeimmäksi infektioiden ehkäisykeinoksi on tunnistettu ilmavälitteisten tartuntojen hillitseminen hiilidioksidimittauksilla, tehokkaalla ilmanvaihdolla ja tarvittaessa ilmanpuhdistuksella. Monessa maassa nämä keinot on jo otettu käyttöön kouluissa, terveydenhuollossa ja julkisissa tiloissa.

Erityisesti lastensuojelulaitoksissa kirjauksia kirjataan useisiin asiakirjoihin, kuten päivittäiskirjauksiin, päätöksiin, hoito- ja kasvatussuunnitelmaan, viikko- ja kuukausikoosteisiin, yhteenvetoihin sekä erilaisiin lausuntoihin.\n\nVarsinais-Suomen alueen lastensuojelujärjestöjen kokemustoimijoille suunnatuissa työpajoissa on noussut esiin, että lastensuojeluyksiköissä on toisistaan eriäviä käytänteitä kirjausten suhteen.\n\nLastensuojelulain mukaan lapsella on oikeus tietää, mitä tietoja hänestä kirjataan asiakastietoihin, kuka niitä kirjaa, milloin ne kirjataan ja millaisia perusteluja eri päätösten ja toimenpiteiden taustalla on. Lapsen osallisuuden toteutumisen kannalta on oleellista, että hänen näkemyksensä ovat kirjausten keskiössä.\n\nLisäksi lapsesta tehtyihin kirjauksiin saatetaan palata vielä vuosia lastensuojelun asiakkuuden päättymisen jälkeen.\n\nSanoilla on valtaa: se, miten asioista kirjoitetaan vaikuttaa siihen, millaisia mielikuvia ja syy-yhteyksiä kirjatusta rakentuu.\n\nLastensuojelun kokemusasiantuntijoiden p",

Vain osa nuorista saa lukea oman kuukausikoosteensa ennen lähettämistä ja vielä harvempi saa kommentoida sen sisältöä.\n\nNuoret kokevat, että kirjauksissa korostuvat usein negatiiviset asiat onnistumisten jäädessä taka-alalle. Nuorilla ei myöskään ole tarvittavaa tietoa omista oikeuksistaan suhteessa kirjauksiin. He eivät esimerkiksi tiedä, miten heidän tulee toimia, jos haluavat nähdä omia kirjauksiaan tai muuttaa niiden sisältöä.\n\nSanoilla on valtaa: se, miten asioista kirjoitetaan vaikuttaa siihen, millaisia mielikuvia ja syy-yhteyksiä kirjatusta rakentuu.\n\nVaihtelevat kirjaamiskäytännöt ja nuorten puutteelliset tiedot omista oikeuksistaan asettavat lastensuojelun asiakkaina olevat lapset ja nuoret eriarvoiseen asemaan.\n\nVaikka dokumentointi sosiaalihuollossa on kehittynyt viime vuosikymmeninä paljon, on kehittämistyötä tehtävä edelleen.

It provides valuable insights into how our training meets the needs and expectations of working life. Professional feedback allows us to improve the quality of our training programmes and to ensure that the knowledge shared with our students is both current and relevant.\n\nWe regularly collect feedback from our partnering businesses and workplace instructors. The feedback helps us in developing degree criteria, learning environments and practical training to better meet the demands of working life.

Approximately 70-100 students start learning at foreign workplaces each year. The work period lasts 1–2 months. The exchange is best suited for the rest of the studies when sufficient professional skills and competence have accumulated in Finland. Our internationalisation projects provide grants for exchanges abroad. The grant usually covers travel and housing.\n\nThe largest number of exchanges are made with Erasmus+ funding to European countries. In some fields, it is also possible to get a job or a study period outside Europe.

We are working for an important cause, says Satu Makkonen, team leader and Senior Lecturer in Business Management at TAI.\n\nKimmo Roine coordinates educational cooperation with the Turku Vocational Institute. As Area Director of K‑Citymarket in the Turku Region, he is responsible for ten K-Citymarkets.\n\n‒ K-Citymarket wants to offer jobs to people with an immigrant background, as we recognise the trade sector’s constantly increasing need for labour. A similar arrangement was previously tested at K-Citymarkets in Pirkanmaa and the Helsinki Metropolitan Area.

A lady on a rollator approaches her in the clothing section and asks where to find women’s underwear.\n\n‒ It’s important to be friendly to customers and help them. I think hard about how to best present myself. I like the clothing section most of all. It’s a nice and safe environment.\n\nThe store is open 24/7, but for the time being, the trainees work in morning shifts that last for six and a half hours.

I can develop my Finnish language skills and get used to a Finnish-language environment. Because Finnish is not my mother tongue, a colleague can sometimes misunderstand me, which can be funny. Then I try again and explain the situation, Vietnamese-speaking Trung explains.\n\nEriksson points out that non-native speakers might have problems understanding customers who speak a dialect.\n\n‒ My Pori dialect isn’t particularly easy to understand, either. The trainees don’t have to have perfect language skills from the beginning. Their language skills develop very quickly, since they speak so much Finnish with colleagues and customers every day.\n\n‒ One of our trainees said that “kengänpohjallinen” (insole) was the funniest word they had learned, Kimmo Roine recounts.\n\n‒ Every trainee started by taking a language test.

Miten saada paletti pyörimään, kun kalenteria täyttävät kaikki muut paitsi nainen itse. Mielenterveysomainen jaksaa ja venyy. Elää puhelin kädessä ja odottaa puheluita, joihin ei haluaisi vastata. Vastaamatta jättäminen ei kuitenkaan ole vaihtoehto. Viranomaiset soittavat tuntemattomista numeroista sekä läheisten hoitajat, sekä läheinen itse, jos ei asu samassa taloudessa. Kaikkiin puheluihin pitää vastata, on siellä sitten lehtimyyjä tai omaisen hoitokontakti. Tämä on yksi monista asioista, jotka nostavat stressiä.\n\nKuinka paljon itse luomme kuvaa siitä, että kukaan muu ei osaa tai pärjää. Kun olemme tottuneet hoitamaan kaiken itse, silloin on myös vaikea luovuttaa hoivavastuuta muille. Osaammeko sanoa ei, en halua, en jaksa. Me olemme omaisia ja huolissamme mielenterveysläheisistämme.

Tukihenkilöä voi hakea, jos kokee tarvitsevansa tukea omaan jaksamiseen. Tukihenkilöä haettaessa alaikäiselle (7 – 17-vuotiaalle), prosessissa voi olla mukana jokin yhteistyötaho perheen lisäksi esimerkiksi kouluterveydenhoitaja, koulukuraattori, hoitava taho tai sosiaalityöntekijä. Tämä ei kuitenkaan ole pakollista, vaan tukihenkilöä alaikäiselle voi hakea myös vain huoltajat.\n\n##### Kuka on tukihenkilö?\n\nTukihenkilö on läsnä oleva, empaattinen, tavallinen aikuinen, joka on yhdistyksen valitsema ja kouluttama vapaaehtoinen. Yhdistyksen työntekijä tekee arvion ja etsii tuettavalle sopivan tukihenkilön huomioiden tuettavan toiveet ja tarpeet sekä tukihenkilön toiveet ja valmiudet vastata tuettavan tarpeisiin.\n\nOsalla yhdistyksen tukihenkilöistä on myös omakohtainen kokemus läheisen psyykkisestä sairaudesta tai päihteiden väärinkäytöstä, ja he toimivat tehtävässä vertaiskokemuksesta käsin. Tämä ei kuitenkaan ole vaatimuksena. Alaikäisten kanssa toimivilta tukihenkilöiltä tarkistetaan  rikosrekisteriote.\n\n##### Mitä tukisuhteessa tehdään?\n\nJokainen tukisuhde muotoutuu oman näköiseksi ja lähtökohtana ovat tuettavan omat tarpeet. Tukihenkilö ja tuettava tapaavat yleensä noin 1-2. krt kuukaudessa ja voivat tehdä yhdessä asioita, jotka tukevat tuettavan hyvinvointia. Tapaamisia voidaan j",

Etätukisuhteessa tapaamiset voidaan myös järjestää etäyhteyksillä.\n\n##### Miten hakea tukihenkilöä?\n\nTukihenkilöä voi hakea itselleen, lapselleen tai asiakkaalleen ottamalla yhteyttä työntekijään haluamallaan tavalla. Työntekijä ja tuettava täyttävät yhdessä tukihenkilöpyyntölomakkeen, jonka jälkeen työntekijä etsii sopivaa tukihenkilöä koulutetuista vapaaehtoisista.\n\nHaettaessa tukihenkilöä alaikäiselle, tulee täyttää erillinen hakulomake. Jos hakemuksen täyttää vanhemmat, työntekijä tapaa vanhemmat sekä alaikäisen ennen tukihenkilön etsimistä. Jos tukihenkilöä perheelle etsii yhteistyötaho kuten sosiaalityöntekijä, koulukuraattori tai hoitava taho, olisi hyvä sopia tapaaminen, jossa V-S FinFamin työntekijä, yhteistyötahon edustaja sekä tukihenkilöä hakeva perhe tapaisivat.

Liputus on kaupungilta tärkeä viesti siitä, että ihmiset halutaan kohdata samanarvoisina. Kuntatason toimijoilla on tässä oleellinen rooli – kyse ei ole poliittisesta mielipiteestä tai aatteesta, vaan ihmisoikeuksista ja tasavertaisesta kohtelusta.\n\nSalon kaupungin strategiaan on kirjoitettu tavoitteeksi hyvinvoiva kunta ja vetovoimainen kaupunki. Tämä toteutuu sitä todennäköisemmin, mitä paremmin vähemmistöihin kuuluvat ja heidän läheisensä tuntevat olonsa tervetulleiksi Salossa.\n\nMoninaisuus on voimavara, mutta vielä on paljon tehtävää siinä, miten ympäröivä yhteiskunta suhtautuu erilaisuuteen. Syrjinnän kokemukset ovat monille arkipäivää. Esimerkiksi transsukupuolisen arjessa seuraavat kysymykset voivat olla jokapäiväisiä: Miten sukulaiset suhtautuvat? Pystyykö palveluihin ilmoittamaan nimen, jota käytän? Tarvitseeko minun joka päivä perustella sukupuoli-identiteettiäni muille?\n\nMielenterveyden ongelmia kokee lähes joka toinen suomalainen jossakin elämänvaiheessa.

Päivä on YK:n lanseeraama teemapäivä, jolla pyritään suuntaamaan huomiota onnellisuuden ja hyvinvoinnin tärkeyteen.\n\nOnnellisuus. Mitä se on? Maailman onnellisimman kansan muutama ystäväni vastasi: tasapainoa, pysyvyyttä, tyytyväisyyttä, keveyttä, hyvää oloa, kiitollisuutta, rauhaa, terveyttä ja rakkautta. Onnellisuus asuu syvällä sielun sokkeloissa, mutta mikä sen herättää uinumasta ja sytyttää liekkeihin?\n\nOnnellisuutta voi olla ohikiitävä hetki, jonka muistoissa paistattelet loppuikäsi. Onko pitkäaikainen, syvällinen onnen tunne tavoittelemisen arvoista? Karkaako se, jos sitä tavoitellaan? Onni on hauraampaa kuin kärsimys.\n\nAuschwitzin painajaiset kokenut Eddie Jaku kirjoittaa kirjassaan Maailman onellisin mies: ”Paras asia, minkä ihminen voi koskaan kokea, on toisen ihmisen rakkaus. Ystävä on se, joka muistuttaa, miten tärkeää on tuntea olevansa elossa. Yksikin hyvä ystävä antaa maailmalle merkityksen. Se on kaikkein tärkeintä.” Eddie jaksoi pitää yllä toivoa, koska Auchwitzissa hänellä on ystävä, jonka takia elää. Ja toivo oli timanttia.\n\nMistä oma onnellisuuteni kumpuaa?

Дополнительные трудности возникают тогда, когда помимо обычных подростковых потрясений, у молодого человека проявляется депрессивное состояние. Заметить депрессию у собственного ребенка иногда сложно. Несмотря на то, что депрессия у подростков протекает точно так же, как и у взрослых, она может проявляться по-разному. Молодой человек может даже не осознавать, что у него депрессия.\n\nКогда следует обратить внимание на состояние вашего подростка?\n\nПсихически здоровый молодой человек способен выражать положительные эмоции, ходить в школу, иметь планы на будущее и пребывать в хорошем настроении. Не всегда отдельные симптомы являются признаком депрессии. О наличии депрессивного состояния можно судить по наличию совокупных признаков: длительности симптомов, способности молодого человека функционировать. Родителям полезно обратить внимание, как молодой человек заботится о себе, каковы его отношения со взрослыми и друзьями, как он справляется с учебой в школе. Проявление симптомов может быть постепенным, поэтому не всегда родителям удается заметить произошедшие изменения.\n\nДепрессия у подростка может проявляться в следующих симптомах:",

Это дает молодому человеку безопасность и стабильность.  Даже небольшие ежедневные вещи могут повлиять на способность справляться с проблемами и на позитивный настрой. Родителям важно следить за режимом сна своего подростка, поскольку при депрессии ритм сна может сбиваться. Разнообразная диета и регулярное питание также будут способствовать улучшению самочувствия. Страдающий депрессией не всегда может и хочет заботиться о себе, поэтому родителям полезно напоминать ребенку, например, о необходимости соблюдать ежедневную гигиену.\n\nРодители могут быть источником безопасности и надежды для молодых людей.

Взрослый, находящийся рядом может помочь подростку конструировать надежды и мечты на будущее. С другой стороны, полезно поддерживать самостоятельность молодого человека и давать ему ответственность за свою жизнь. Любому подростку важно иметь физическое и эмоциональное пространство для развития, для познания себя, своих границ и своего потенциала. Речь идет также о пространстве для того, чтобы делать то, что для него в данный момент является важным, а также чтобы совершать ошибки и экспериментировать. Так, будет усиливаться чувство восприятия самого себя, как способного справляться с трудностями жизни. От молодых людей можно и нужно ожидать результатов, которые могут достигаться постепенно. Можно вместе договориться о небольших ежедневных обязанностях. Вы также можете помочь подростку предвидеть стрессовые ситуации. Важно признать наличие у молодого человека стрессовых проблем, а не преуменьшать их значение. Родителям не следует перегружать депрессивного человека собственными трудностями.\n\nИзвестно, что физические упражнения и прогулки на свежем воздухе улучшают настроение.

Родители часто приспосабливают свою повседневную жизнь к потребностям подростка, например, берут отгулы на работе, чтобы ухаживать и присматривать за молодым человеком. Поэтому одной из важнейших задач родителей является забота о собственном благополучии и здоровье. Чтобы быть в состоянии поддерживать своего подростка, вы сами должны чувствовать себя хорошо. Несмотря на болезнь подростка, вы, как родитель, имеете право на собственное время, друзей и увлечения. Ваше хорошее самочувствие всегда в интересах подростка.\n\nРодители часто чувствуют себя виноватыми, когда их ребенок заболевает. Вопросы и размышления о том, «почему это произошло с моим ребенком» или «что я сделал не так“ отнимают много сил. Важно найти пространство, где вы могли бы говорить о своих чувствах и выражать их вербально. Обсуждать их можно с партнером или друзьями.

Hän oli tuolloin jo ammattilainen mielenterveysalalla, mutta V-S FinFamin olemassaolo tuli hänelle uutena tietona. Tämä ensitieto herätti hänessä kiinnostuksen, joka myöhemmin syveni henkilökohtaisen tarpeen myötä, kun hänen perheessään kohdattiin mielenterveysongelmia. Sirpan kokemus on esimerkki siitä, kuinka yhdistys tavoittaa ihmisiä heidän tarpeidensa äärellä, tarjoten tukea ja toivoa.\n\n#### Saadut Hyödyt ja Kokemukset\n\nV-S FinFamin toimintaan osallistuminen on antanut Sirpalle paljon enemmän kuin vain vertaistukea. Hän on kokenut henkilökohtaista kasvua, oppinut käsittelemään häpeää ja muita tunteita, ja löytänyt iloa ja naurua yhteisön keskellä. Nämä kokemukset ovat olleet korvaamattomia hänen omassa elämässään. Sirpan tarina korostaa, kuinka V-S FinFami ei ainoastaan tue mielenterveysongelmien kanssa kamppailevia ja heidän läheisiään, vaan myös edistää jokaisen jäsenensä henkilökohtaista ja emotionaalista kehitystä.\n\n#### Aktiivinen Osallistuminen\n\nSirpa on toiminut V-S FinFamissa monissa rooleissa: hallituksen jäsenenä, puheenjohtajana ja ryhmien vetäjänä. Erityisesti Prospect-ryhmät ovat olleet hänelle sydämen asia. Hän on vetänyt lukuisia ryhmiä ja kokenut, kuinka merkityks",

Sirpan aktiivinen osallistuminen yhdistyksen toimintaan heijastaa V-S FinFamin ydinarvoja: yhteisöllisyyttä, empatiaa ja jatkuvaa sitoutumista jäsentensä hyvinvointiin.\n\n#### Yhdistyksen Kehitys\n\nV-S FinFamin toiminta on vuosien varrella muuttunut ammattimaisemmaksi. Sirpa näkee tämän positiivisena kehityksenä, sillä se on helpottanut vapaaehtoisten työtaakkaa ja mahdollistanut keskittymisen itse auttamistyöhön ilman huolta käytännön järjestelyistä, kuten rahoituksesta. Muutos on mahdollistanut yhdistyksen kasvun ja laajentumisen, mikä puolestaan on lisännyt sen vaikutusmahdollisuuksia yhteiskunnassa.\n\n#### Erityiset Hetket ja Oivallukset\n\nVaikka Sirpa ei mainitse yksittäistä määrittävää hetkeä, hän korostaa jokaisen ryhmätapaamisen tuomaa sykähdyttävää tunnetta, kun näkee vertaistuen konkreettisen vaikutuksen. Hän on oppinut, että omasta hyvinvoinnista huolehtiminen ei ole pois sairastuneelta, vaan päinvastoin, se voi tuoda hyvää myös läheisille. Tämä oivallus on keskeinen osa V-S FinFamin opetusta: jokaisen on huolehdittava ensin itsestään, jotta voi olla tukemassa muita.\n\n#### Pysyminen Mukana\n\nSirpa pysyy V-S FinFamissa, koska vapaaehtoistyö tuo hänelle onnellisuutta ja jatkuvia oivalluksia.

Ihan aluksi pyydän sinua pysähtymään ja pohtimaan, mitä nämä osa-alueet tarkoittavat juuri sinulle? Mitä kaikkea ne pitävät sisällään?\n\nVaikka terveyttä voidaan mitata erilaisin keinoin, on jokaisella kuitenkin hyvin subjektiivinen, henkilökohtainen kokemus omasta terveydestään. Jonkun elämäntavat voivat näyttäytyä toiselle epäterveellisinä, mutta henkilö voi itse kokea elävänsä riittävän tervettä ja juuri omannäköistä elämää. Tämä onkin tärkeä asia, elämästä saa rakentaa juuri itselleen omannäköisen ja mielekkään. Eikä siitä ole vastuussa muille kuin itselleen. On tärkeää kunnioittaa toisten tapoja elää ja olla, antaa kaikkien kukkien kukkia rauhassa. Tai ainakin jättää arvostelevat ja hyödyttömät kommentit omaan tietoonsa. Se, miten puhuu ja kohtaa muut ihmiset, on sitä energiaa, jota viljelee ympärilleen. Pyrkimys yhteiseen hyvään vaikuttaa terveyteen. On tärkeää myös pohtia, mitä hyvää on tehnyt itsensä eteen, miten voisi entistä paremmin helliä ja huomioida itseään? Olenko muistanut kertoa itselleni tänään, miten ylpeä olen itsestäni ja miten arvokkaana itseäni pidän?\n\nJoskus toisen terveydentila ja elämäntavat vaikuttavat väistämättä toiseen, esimerkiksi vanhemman sairaudet tai päihteiden käyttö.

Lapsi ei ole vastuussa itse itsestään, vaan aikuinen on aina vastuussa lapsesta. Moni perhe sekä yksilö tarvitsee ulkopuolista apua, ja monia läheisiä saattaa kuormittaa erilaiset haasteet. Avun vastaanottaminen on rohkeutta astua ulos omavoimaisuudesta ja pärjäämisestä. Jos huomaa oman fyysisen tai psyykkisen oireilun seurauksena läheisen kärsivän, on tärkeää pyytää apua. En kuitenkaan väitä, että avun piiriin pääseminen tapahtuisi käden käänteessä tai olisi muutenkaan helppoa. Omaan terveyskeskukseen voit aina soittaa, eikä kannata odottaa kriisin kärjistymistä. Sinulla on oikeus soittaa apua. Sinulla on myös oikeus soittaa erilaisiin päivystäviin puhelinnumeroihin, kuten kriisikeskuksen numeroon tarvittaessa.

Vuonna 2006, kun entinen puheenjohtaja soitti hänelle kertoen avoimesta toiminnanjohtajan paikasta, Samuli päätti hakea tehtävään. Tämä rohkea loikka yksityiseltä sektorilta yhdistysmaailmaan oli ensiaskel hänen pitkälle ja antoisalle matkalleen V-S FinFamissa. Tämä kertoo paljon V-S FinFamin vetovoimasta ja siitä, kuinka yhdistys osaa tunnistaa ja hyödyntää potentiaalia eri taustoista tulevissa ihmisissä.\n\n#### Kokemukset ja kasvu FinFamissa\n\nOsallistuminen V-S FinFamin toimintaan on tarjonnut Samulille paljon enemmän kuin vain työkokemusta. Hän mainitsee saaneensa ”inhimillistä pääomaa”, joka käsittää uusia tuttavuuksia, muistoja ja kokemuksia. Samuli on osallistunut monenlaisiin koulutuksiin, kuten mielenterveyden ensiapuun ja depressiokouluohjaajakoulutuksiin, jotka ovat syventäneet hänen ymmärrystään alasta ja ihmismielestä. V-S FinFamin tarjoama koulutus ja tuki ovat olleet korvaamattomia, ja ne ovat mahdollistaneet Samulille syvällisen perehtymisen mielenterveystyöhön.\n\n#### Merkitykselliset hetket ja yhdistyksen kehitys\n\nYksi Samulin uran kohokohdista oli osallistuminen merkittävän hankkeen hakuprosessiin, joka vaati pitkää ja intensiivistä työsk",

Tämä hanke, joka myöhemmin saatiin rahoitettua, oli merkittävä voitto yhdistykselle ja sen tulevaisuudelle. V-S FinFamin toiminta on muuttunut vuosien varrella ammatillisempaan suuntaan, työntekijämäärän kasvaessa ja toiminnan laajentuessa. Samuli on nähnyt, kuinka yhdistys on kehittynyt ja vahvistanut asemaansa mielenterveystyön kentällä, mikä on osoitus V-S FinFamin kyvystä mukautua ja vastata ajan haasteisiin.\n\n#### Vaikutus henkilökohtaiseen ja ammatilliseen elämään\n\nSamulin kokemukset V-S FinFamissa ovat vaikuttaneet syvästi hänen arvoihinsa ja ajattelutapaansa. Hän on oppinut arvostamaan yhteisöllisyyttä ja ymmärtänyt, kuinka tärkeää on puhua avoimesti myös vaikeista asioista. Tämä oivallus on siirtynyt myös hänen henkilökohtaiseen elämäänsä, parantaen hänen kykyään kohdata erilaisia ihmisiä ja tilanteita.

Nuori voi alkaa vältellä koulua, aikuinen turvautua päihteisiin “vain rauhoittuakseen”, oma ahdistus voi räjähtää päälle paniikkina julkisissa tiloissa. Taustalla on usein kokemusten summa: huutelut bussissa, epäasialliset kohtaamiset sote-palveluissa, katseet kaupungilla, pelko kädestä pitämisestä julkisella paikalla. Pelko olla oma itsensä. EU-tasolla suuri osa LGBTIQA+-ihmisistä raportoi yhä julkisten kiintymyksenosoitusten välttelyä ja toistuvaa häirintää; se ei ole pieni asia, vaan kroonista stressiä ja pelkoa ylläpitävää todellisuutta sateenkaari-ihmisille.\n\nSamalla poliittisten päätöste",

Tänä keväänä oikeusministeriö ei ottanut valmisteluun lainsäädäntöä eheytyshoitojen kieltämiseksi, vaikka eduskunta oli jo hyväksynyt tätä ajaneen kansalaisaloitteen. Eheytyshoidolla tarkoitetaan uskomushoitoa, jolla pyritään muuttamaan seksuaalivähemmistöihin kuuluvia ihmisiä kuten homoseksuaaleja heteroseksuaaleiksi sekä sukupuolivähemmistöihin kuuluvia ihmisiä joko mieheksi tai naiseksi.\n\nSateenkaarivähemmistöjen vastaiset toimet ovat yleistyneet ympäri Eurooppaa.

Tavoitteenamme on, että jokainen henkilö saa laadukasta, tasa-arvoista palvelua.\n\nKohtaamisen pelisäännöt löydät helposti Instagramista ja Facebookista.

Mitä vuosi 2024 Sinulle antoi? Riittikö terveyden määrä toimintakykyysi? Koitko elämän myrskyjä, jotka paiskasivat Sinut kohti rantakallioita? Vai pulppuava iloko tuikki silmissäsi? Rakastitko niin, että sattuu? Entä suhde läheiseesi – unohditko itsesi vai nousitko haasteiden yli ja olit terveesti itsekäs? Uskalsitko olla itsellesi rehellinen?\n\nTasan vuosi sitten pysähdyin näiden kysymysten ääreen. Mietin Reinhold Niebuhrin nimissä olevaa tyyneysrukousta: ”Anna minulle tyyneyttä hyväksyä asiat, joita en voi muuttaa. Rohkeutta muuttaa niitä, joita voin. Ja viisautta erottaa nämä toisistaan.” Pitkään harkittuani uskalsin katsoa elämää silmiin ja astua varovasti kohti uutta. Uteliaana, askel kerrallaan. Vuodesta 2024 tuli merkityksellisen huikea matka, jossa päällimmäisenä tunteena löytyi ilo ja onnellisuus. Mutta itse piti ottaa ensimmäinen askel. Kukaan ei tehnyt sitä puolestani.\n\nElämä on kantanut, elämä kantaa. Ollessaan rehellinen itselleen ihminen löytää itsensä näköisen elämän. Muu olisi hukkaanheittämistä. Rohkeus ja vahvuus antavat potkua eteenpäin. Hetkeen tarttuminen tulee mahdolliseksi ja aidoksi. Rehellisyys itseämme kohtaan koituu myös hyödyksi läheisillemme.

Tässä artikkelissa keskitymme Raijan kokemuksiin, jotka heijastavat yhdistyksen merkitystä ja vaikutusta jäsentensä elämässä.\n\n### Mukaan toimintaan\n\nKun Raija (psykoterapeutti ja työnohjaaja) ensimmäisen kerran kuuli V-S FinFamista, yhdistys tunnettiin vielä Lounais-Suomen omaisyhdistyksenä. Tieto löytyi Turun Sanomien työpaikkailmoituksesta, joka johti hänet yhdistyksen haastatteluun ja sittemmin seitsemän vuoden mittaiseen työsuhteeseen. Tämä oli alku yhteydelle, joka on kestänyt yli kolme vuosikymmentä ja jatkuu edelleen.\n\n### Monia tehtäviä\n\nRaijan tarina V-S FinFamissa on kertomus innostuksesta ja sitoutumisesta. Alkuun hän työskenteli ainoana palkattuna työntekijänä, mutta vähitellen yhdistys kasvoi ja muuttui, kuten myös Raijan roolit: aluesihteeristä koulutussihteeriin ja toiminnanjohtajaksi. Kun Raija jätti päivittäisen työrupeaman yhdistyksessä taakseen, hän jatkoi Salon omaisyhdistyksen ja Keskusliiton hallituksen jäsenenä, toimi V-S Finfamin vapaaehtoistehtävissä ja joskus myös johonkin tehtävään palkattuna, mikä kuvastaa hänen syvää sitoutumistaan yhdistyksen toimintaan.\n\n### Kohtaamisia\n\nV-S",

Hän muistelee, kuinka alussa jäsenkirjeet postitettiin käsin yhdessä puheenjohtajan ja yhden yhdistyksen jäsenen kanssa. Tämä antoi mahdollisuuden syvällisiin keskusteluihin ja ymmärryksen lisääntymiseen läheisten tilanteista ja asemasta. Raija kertoo, että nämä kokemukset ovat syventäneet hänen käsitystään ihmisten välisestä yhteydestä ja yhteisön voimasta.\n\n### Laajentuva ja monipuolistuva yhdistys\n\nYhdistyksen muutos vuosien varrella on ollut huomattava. Raijan aloittaessa V-S FinFamissa työntekijöitä oli vain muutama, mutta vuosien saatossa yhdistys on laajentunut ja monipuolistunut huomattavasti. Tämä kasvu on mahdollistanut laajemman vaikuttamisen mielenterveyden edistämiseen sekä alueellisesti että valtakunnallisesti.\n\n### Omat oivallukset\n\nRaijan mukaan tärkein oppi V-S FinFamissa on ollut yhteisön voima ja yksilöiden kyky vaikuttaa. Hän on nähnyt, kuinka yhteiset tavoitteet ja selkeä suunta voivat saada aikaan merkittäviä muutoksia. Tämä on opettanut hänelle luottamusta ja toivoa, jotka ovat olleet tärkeitä niin hänen ammatillisessa kuin henkilökohtaisessakin elämässään.\n\n### Jäsenyys on kannanotto\n\nMikä sitten saa Raijan pysymään V-S FinFamin jäsenenä vuosikymmenestä toiseen?

Vertaistuki toi itselleni lohtua siitä, miten jollain muulla voi olla samankaltaisia kokemuksia ja ajatuksia. Kun vertainen sanoi ääneen asioita, mitä minä ajattelin ja, kenellekkään en ole pystynyt niitä koskaan ääneen sanomaan; niin siinä kohtaa ymmärtää, ettei ole omaisena asioiden kanssa yksin, eikä tarvitsekkaan olla.\n\nFinFamin vertaistuellinen omaisneuvonta on arvokasta ja haluan tukea yhdistystä siinä, että toiminta edelleen jatkuisi. Lähdin vertaisneuvojakoulutukseen, koska haluan olla avuksi muille, joilla on samanlaisia kokemuksia mielenterveysomaisena. Hienointa olisi, jos oma kokemukseni omaisena olemisesta toisi jollekkin toiselle lohtua ja turvaa. Parasta vertaisneuvojakoulutuksessa oli, kun saimme kuulla kokenneelta vertaisneuvojalta hänen tarinansa, miksi hän oli aikoinaan tullut FinFamille. Hän Lisäksi hän antoi meille vinkkejä vertaistukineuvojana olemisesta. Jaoimme hänelle myöskin oman tarinamme, joka oli yksi koulutuksen harjoituksista. Koulutus oli todella hyvä ja käytännönläheinen. Teimme paljon muitakin harjoituksia ja saimme hyviä työkaluja.

Äitini kuolikin pari vuotta sitten lääkkeiden ja alkoholin sekakäyttöön, joten tämä osa on elämästäni kadonnut, mutta haluan pystyä tukemaan muita ihmisiä ketkä joutuvat koville omaistensa takia. Olen käynyt FinFamin tukiryhmissä, ja niiden jälkeen kouluttautunut itsekin vertaisomaiseksi, jotta voin antaa hyvän kiertää eteenpäin. Pidetään toisistamme huolta, olen mielelläni valmis kuuntelemaan kenen tahansa elämäntarinaa, ja toivon voivani olla tueksi.\n\nMies, +20v\n\nOlen työelämässä oleva kolmen aikui",

Isä vaikutti itsenäiseltä ja hyvinvoivalta. Pikkuhiljaa minulle alkoi selvitä, millaisia päihde- ja mielenterveysongelmia hänellä todellisuudessa ulospäin näytetyn kuoren alla oli. Tässä vaiheessa olimme jo asuneet yhdessä melkein kaksi vuotta, ja lapsi oli tullut minulle kuin omaksi. Lapsen äiti ei ollut mainittavissa määrin mukana lapsen elämässä. Minusta tuntui että parisuhteen ja lapsen sijaan minulla olikin kaksi lasta kasvatettavana. Yritin parhaani mukaan auttaa sekä isää ammattiavun piiriin että erityislasta oikean hoitomuodon löytymisessä.\n\nErosimme isän kanssa lapsen ollessa 6-vuotias. Isän tilanne oli pahentunut entisestään, eikä hän pystynyt huolehtimaan lapsestaan. Teimme yhteistyössä lastensuojeluilmoituksen. Yleisenä toiveena oli, että isä saa tarvitsemaansa apua, ja että lapsi jää hänelle. Lapsi oli minulla kouluaamuisin ja isän oli määrä hakea hänet iltapäivällä, mutta isä ei koskaan tullut. Lapsen piti mennä isälleen viikonlopuksi, mutta viedessäni lasta hän ei ollutkaan kotona.\n\nLapsen kipuilu ja oma huoli sairastutti minut\n\nSeur",

Lapsen piti mennä isälleen viikonlopuksi, mutta viedessäni lasta hän ei ollutkaan kotona.\n\nLapsen kipuilu ja oma huoli sairastutti minut\n\nSeurasin vierestä lapsen jokapäiväistä pettymystä siitä, miten rakas vanhempi oli täysin hylännyt hänet. Lopulta sairastuin itsekin. Uupumukseni ilmeni fyysisinä oireina: Sain pahoja astmakohtausta muistuttavia hengitysoireita, enkä pystynyt nukkumaan pariin kuukauteen.\n\nSurullinen ja huolestunut lapsi käpertyi kylkeeni joka ilta. Kun sain hänet nukahtamaan, itkin niin paljon, kuin minulta kyyneliä riitti. Enemmän kuin itseäni, minua sattui katsoa lapsen pikkuhiljaa katoavaa elämäniloa. Tilalle tuli lapsi, joka heräsi joka yö monta kertaa kiljumaan täysillä jostain painajaisesta tai kun minä nousin sängystä. Tätä painajaisiin heräämistä kesti yli kaksi vuotta, sitten se alkoi vähetä muutamaan kertaan viikossa, ja nyt 5 vuotta myöhemmin sitä ei enää ole.\n\nOlin lapselle se turvallinen aikuinen\n\nVirallinen statukseni on nykyään sijaisvanhempi. Kun eron jälkeen huomasin, että isä ei ota vastuuta lapsestaan, aloitin taisteluni, että saan itse olla lapselle se turvallinen vanhempi. Ensimmäisen vajaan vuoden aikana minulle sanottiin, että en voi pitää lasta. Välillä minulle sanottiin, että lapsi sijoitetaan kiireisesti ja toisinaan että lapsi täytyy huostaanottaa. Viesti oli aina sama, että lapsi viedään pois. Olin niin shokissa, että rehellisesti sanottua, en edes muista mitä kaikkea tuona",

Kun lapsi oli koulussa, käytin aikani selvittäen, mitä voin tehdä lapsen hyväksi. Menetin tälle ajalle itseni täysin. Ulospäin näytin reippaalta äitipuolelta, kotona olin itkuinen ihmisraunio. Minulla ei ollut aikaa ystäville tai harrastuksille.\n\nIsän toipuminen on auttanut meitä kaikkia\n\nIsän toipuminen alkoi noin puoli vuotta erosta, kun hän ensimmäisen kerran omasta aloitteestaan hakeutui avun piiriin. Toipuminen on pitkä prosessi, ja se on edelleen kesken. Viimeisen kahden viikon aikana olen kolme kertaa löytänyt itseni tilanteesta, jossa kasvatan häntä isänä olemaan aikuinen omalle lapselleen. Pienin askelin isä kuitenkin on ottanut isompaa roolia lapsen elämässä. Olemme nyt käyneet kolmen vuoden ajan perheterapiassa, jossa isä on ollut mukana viimeisen vuoden. Perheterapiassa sekä kasvatus- ja perheneuvolassa olen saanut suurimman tuen ja avun. He ovat osanneet auttaa sekä lasta luomaan uudelleen luottamussuhdetta isään että minua ymmärtämään, että minun on huolehdittava myös itsestäni jaksaakseni hoitaa lasta.\n\nPikkuhiljaa toivuin itsekin\n\nVaikeinta minun oli myöntää itselleni, että minä en voi pelastaa isää.

Uhraamalla oman hyvinvointini hänen auttamiseensa aiheutin itselleni pahoja traumoja. Hänen toimintansa sai minut lopulta uskomaan, että olen huijari ja valehtelija, joka ei muuta halua kuin puuttua toisen elämään. Toisaalta tämä sama sinnikkyys lapsen kanssa on vienyt lapsen tilannetta hurjasti eteenpäin. Jotain hyvää siinäkin siis on, ettei luovuta. Tärkeintä on kuitenkin ollut oppia sanomaan ”Ei” ja vetämään niitä oman jaksamisen rajoja. Aloitin harjoittelun tosi pienin askelin sanomalla ’ei’ kun isä pyysi rahaa. Annoin suivaantuneen isän olla, vaikka teki mieli antaa periksi. Vasta kun lakkasin olemasta liian kiltti, isä sai mahdollisuuden itse selvittää asiansa.\n\nToki hän on edelleen läheiseni, ja kun tiedän hänellä olevan kiireistä, saatan muistutella häntä sovituista. Teen sen kuitenkin vain omien voimieni puitteissa, ja jos hän erikseen pyytää. Tänä päivänä olen oppinut nauttimaan päivistä ja hetkistä. Nyt voin jo katsoa taaksepäin, ja todeta, että lapsi on selvinnyt uskomattoman hienosti. Hän on taas oma iloinen itsensä, luonnollinen ja menevä. Kyyneleet nousevat uudelleen silmiini.

Yhdistämme voimamme Salon seudun FinFamin toiminnan siirtyessä osaksi V-S FinFamin toimintaa.\n\nYhdessä toimien voimme tukea omaisia entistä paremmin ja monipuolisemmin. Järjestökenttä on monien haasteiden edessä, samanaikaisesti mielenterveysomaisten tuen tarve kasvaa. Uudella organisoinnilla pystymme luomaan omaistoimintaa myös uusiin kuntiin yhdessä vapaaehtoisten ja ammattilaisten kanssa. Yhdistymisellä vastataan myös sote-uudistuksen ja maakuntamallin tuomiin muutostarpeisiin. Neuvottelut julkisen sektorin kanssa käydään jatkossa laajemmilla maantieteellisillä alueilla kuin yksittäisissä kunnissa.\n\nJärjestöjen tulevaisuuden rahoitus on muuttumassa radikaalistikin. Yhteistyöllä varmistetaan omaistyön jatkuminen, kun rajattuja resursseja, euroja ja vapaaehtoisten aikaa käytetään mahdollisimman vähän hallintoon ja mahdollisimman paljon omaisten tukemiseen.\n\nSekä Turun että Salon toimipisteet palvelevat jatkossakin totuttuun tapaan.

Teetkö tilinpäätöstä vuoden vaihteessa menneestä ja ojentaudut samalla tulevaan? Muisteletko kuluneen vuoden iloja, suruja, kenties saavutuksia tai itketkö menetyksiä? Mikä jäi päällimmäisenä mieleen? Rakastuitko niin, etteivät jalat meinanneet pysyä maassa? Löysitkö uuden harrastuksen?\n\nItselläni on usein ollut tapana pysähtyä koetun äärelle. Tänä vuonna iloitsin ainoan tätini, Eila-tädin, 90-vuotispäivistä. Toiseksi kiitollisena mietin, miten paljon taideharrastukset ja kädentaidot ovat antaneet palikoita mielenterveysomaisena jaksamiseen. Kolmantena rikkautena luonto – tuo ehtymätön, mittaamattoman antoisa aarrearkku. Neljäntenä yksi suuri unelmani toteutui, kun lahjamatkani tyttäreni kanssa Hollannin Keukenhofiin onnistui; vaikea keksiä mitään miljoonia tulppaaneja kauniimpaa! Lisäksi vuosi antoi sellaista odottamatonta onnea ja iloa, josta on muisteltavaa vielä kiikkustuolissakin. Elämässä voi tapahtua myös yllättäviä, isoja onnen hetkiä.\n\nVaikka ”elämä tarjoo kyyneleitä. Ei niiltä välty yksikään”, kuten Petri Laaksonen laulaa (Kun aamu koittaa: Petri Laaksonen & Sinikka Svärd), asenteemme elämän haasteisiin voimme aina valita. Elämä todellakin tarjoaa myrskyjä, toki välillä hieman tyvenempää. Niin pimeää paikkaa ei olekaan, ettei sieltä vähäisintä valon kajetta löydy. Etsimisen jälkeen valon kaje voi ",

Etsimisen jälkeen valon kaje voi vahvistua ja seljetä. Jälleen jaksamme askel kerrallaan, eikö vain? Valolle pitää myös antaa mahdollisuus.\n\nMitä sitten itse toivon uudelta vuodelta? Toivon, että olen oppinut menneestä, eletystä elämästä riittävästi. Kunpa ojentautuisin hyvään ja kiinnittäisin ajatukseni omien voimavarojeni hoitamiseen. Että löydän ilon ja innostuksen jokaisesta auringonnoususta. Kenties saan riittävästi terveyttä sekä toimintakykyä iloitakseni työstäni ja harrastuksistani. Toivon kovasti, että en liiaksi katso taaksepäin alas laaksoihin, vaan kohotan katseeni ylöspäin ja eteenpäin. Tuskin ripaus rakkauttakaan olisi pahitteeksi!\n\nJos edes osan näistä saan, voinko kylliksi kiittää? Silloin jaksan varmasti kaiken sen, mitä elämä tarjoaa vuonna 2024 – myöskin omaisena.\n\nSiskoni Sirpa Mäkisen runossa ojentaudutaan myös uuteen:\n\nMyötäile veden virtaa, \nkuuntele tuulen tuomaa.\nAnna auringon lämmittää pilvet pois,\nsalaman valaista\npolkusi kaarta.\nUskalla uusille ulapoille,\nnouse seuraavallekin huipulle.\nVasta pimeässä voi nähdä tähdet!\n\nHyvää uutta vuotta 2024!

Onko näistä jokin suosikkisi?\n\nLieneekö ikääntymisen merkki, kun lapsuuden muistot viipyvät mielessä aiempaa enemmän? Aika on toki kullannut niistä osan. Olen onnellinen siitä, että suurin osa niistä on myönteisiä ja kantavat yhä.\n\nTänä vuonna tein itse hyvin yksilöllisen joulukalenterin. Minua on siunattu neljällä tyttärellä ja on aika muistaa heitä. Kirjoitin 24 tositarinaa oman lapsuuteni jouluista, talvista, koulumuistoista ja arjen hyörinöistä. Tiedän, että heille nämä kaikki ovat uusia tarinoita. Parasta lienee, että he kaikki odottavat niiden julkaisemista!\n\nJoulu on rakkauden ja antamisen juhla. Kaiken ei kuitenkaan tarvitse olla materiasta kiinni. Pienistä teoista, oman ajan jakamisesta tai avun tarjoamisesta voi jäädä unohtumattomat muistot sekä antajalle, että avun saajalle. Pientä luovaa ajatuksen askartelua – ja voit olla iloksi toiselle.\n\nKiintymyksen osoittaminen läheisimmille on ainutlaatuisen tärkeää – rakastettuna olemista ei voita mikään. S",

Hankkeessa kehitettiin ja juurrutettiin myös uusia verkkovapaaehtoistoiminnan muotoja osaksi yhdistyksen vapaaehtoistoimintaa. Hankkeen toiminta oli pääosin verkossa ja  tarjolla oli tukea valtakunnallisesti ja monikanavaisesti.\n\nVuoden 2023 lopussa hankkeessa kehitettiin myös FinFami-alueyhdistysten valtakunnallista yhteistyötä  ja yhdistettiin eri alueyhdistysten toteuttama valtakunnallinen nuorten läheisten toiminta yhden nimen, Huolenkantajat, alle.

Löysin noin viisi vuotta sitten isäni suvun, kun Australiassa asuva pikkuserkkuni otti yhteyttä. Monen mutkan kautta tapasimme ja myös sukukokous saatiin aikaan. Tuolloin hän lähetti minulle kuvan eukalyptuspuusta, jota en tule unohtamaan. Australiaan ”kuuluvat” metsäpalot. Kuvassa monen hiiltyneen, äkkiseltään katsottuna kuolleen puun rungon seassa löytyy puu, joka on alkanut versoa uutta. Eikä ainoastaan uutta, vaan jotain käsittämättömän kaunista. Vaaleanpunaiset läpikuultavan kauniit, elämää täynnä olevat lehdet työntyvät ryppäänä ulospäin saaden koko puun kukkaan; vaikka koko runko näyttää kuolleelta.\n\nJoskus elämässä on näin. Pitkän, vaikean jakson jälkeen saattaa olla, että auringonsäteet sittenkin löytävät tiensä luoksemme. Elämä kantaa hiiltyneestä herkkään. Hetken tie on kevyt kulkea.\n\nSe kantaa myös tulevalla viikolla, jolloin vietämme mielenterveysviikkoa. On äärimmäisen tärkeää, että mielenterveyden hoitaminen on enenemässä määrin esillä. Tähän linkittyy oleellisesti myös omaisten jaksaminen.\n\nWHO:n määritelmän mukaan terveys on suhteellinen hyvinvoinnin tila, erilaisista sairauksista huolimatta. Mielenterveys voi olla samalla tavalla suhteellinen hyvinvoinnin tila. Ei ole yhtä ainoaa oikeaa stabiilia tilaa. Elämän kerrostuneisuus, läheisten voinnin vaihte",

Puita on kyllä pihalla useita ja metsä takapihallamme, mutta keskityn nyt juuri tuota puuta katsomaan. Puu ei ole erityisen kaunis, sen oksat haarautuvat miten sattuu. Oksien päällä on lunta, yksi lintu istuu ylimmällä oksalla. Kaarna on pääosin harmaan sävyistä. Jotain kaunista ja voimakasta tuossa puussa kuitenkin on. Se elää.\n\nPuu noudattaa luonnollista sykliään. Lehdet ovat tippuneet maahan, ja tietynlainen lehtien kuolemisen prosessi on alkanut. Muutama pienempi oksakin on katkennut. Lumi on haudannut ne alleen. Se on elämän kiertoa, jota ei pysty hallitsemaan. Tai pystyy, mutta se tuottaa kipua.\n\nMitä tällainen sykliys tarkoittaa ihmisen elämässä? Se voi tarkoittaa jostain asiasta, ihmisestä tai tilanteesta irti päästämistä, se voi olla rajojen asettamista, ein sanomista, vanhasta tavarasta luopumista, lapsen synnyttämistä. Tarkoitan, että aivan kuten puut ja muut olennot noudattavat tätä luonnollista sykliään, niin noudatamme mekin. Joskus se on vaikeaa. Se voi pelottaa. Olen kuullut, että kiinni pitämisen tuska voi kuitenkin olla suurempaa kuin irti päästämisen tuska. Tiedän, se voi sattua.\n\nAivan kuten tuo puu, myös sinä olet elossa. Sinun kehosi ja mielesi on muokkautuva, soluja kuolee ja uusia syntyy tilalle. Vanhoja ajatuksia voi kuolla ja uusia syntyä tilalle, jos uskallat pitää mielesi auki.\n\nVoitko ottaa hetken, vai",

Tyyneltä veden pinnalta? Lämpimältä silokalliolta? Saunan lempeältä syleilyltä? Varmasti meille jokaiselle vähän erilaiselta, mutta ehkä siinä on samoja tunteita kuitenkin. Oma mieleni voi hyvin, kun koen olevani turvassa, hyväksytty omana itsenäni osana yhteisöä.\n\nVuosi sitten kirjoitin Pride-kuukauden yhteydessä uskalluksesta yhdistyksemme arvona. Muita arvojamme ovat luottamus, kunnioitus ja lämpö. Nämä ovat peruskiviä mielen hyvinvoinnin tukemiseen, ja se on koko toimintamme ydin. Kun luotamme toisiimme, olemme turvassa. Kun kohtelemme toisiamme kunnioittavasti, luomme hyväksyntää jokaiselle yksilönä. Lämmin kohtaaminen antaa rauhaa.\n\nValitettavasti yhteiskunnassamme nämä arvot eivät edelleenkään toteudu. Viime vuoden Turun Pride-tapahtumassa 89 prosenttia kyselyymme vastanneista kertoi kantavansa huolta läheisestään, jolla on mielenterveyden tai päihteiden käytön haasteita, ja näistä läheisistä 67 prosenttia kuului sukupuoli- tai seksuaalivähemmistöön. Kaikki eivät koe olevansa hyväksyttyjä, ja tämä kuormittaa mieltä.\n\nKansalaisjärjestönä olemme aktiivisesti kehittäneet seksuaali- ja sukupuolivähemmistöjen huomioimista toiminnassamme kuitenkin vasta vuodesta 2021. Hiljainen hyväksyntä ei riitä, vaan järjestöjen tehtävänä on olla my",

Joka vuosi olemme osallistuneet Turku Pride -tapahtumaan, jonka lisäksi 2021 teimme HLBT-henkilön huomioimisen pelisäännöt ja haastoimme somekampanjalla muita toimijoita sitoutumaan näihin pelisääntöihin.

Viime vuonna osallistuimme kaikkiin Varsinais-Suomessa järjestettyihin Pride-kulkueisiin ja lupauksemme oli lisätä kuvituksiemme sisältöihin moninaisuutta. Tänä vuonna haastoimme Mielenterveysomaisten keskusliitto FinFamin järjestämään valtakunnallisen koulutuksen sukupuoli- ja seksuaalivähemmistöön kuuluvien henkilöiden kohtaamisesta.

V-S FinFami on jo vuosien ajan tarjonnut ammattilaisille koulutusta läheisten kohtaamiseen ja tukemiseen. Nyt koulutus on suoritettavissa myös verkkokoulutuksena Mielenterveystalo.fi-sivustolla.\n\nOmaistyön koulutuksen tavoitteena on lisätä ammattilaisten tietoa omaisten ja läheisten tuen tarpeesta sekä antaa työkaluja heidän huomioimiseensa eri palveluissa. Omaiset ja läheiset kokevat usein edelleen jäävänsä yksin, kun hoito keskittyy sairastuneeseen. Toisaalta he eivät välttämättä aina tunnista tuen tarvetta, kun hätä läheisestä on suuri. Ammattilaisilla on tärkeä rooli sairastuneen omaisten ja läheisten tunnistamisessa ja palveluihin ohjaamisessa.\n\nFinFami-yhdistykset eri puolilla Suomea tarjoavat monipuolista tukea sairastavan tai oireilevan lähipiirille sekä järjestävät ammattilaisille koulutusta. Omaistyön koulutuksessa esitellään tietopaketti FinFamin mielenterveysomaistyöstä ja työmuodoista. Koulutuspaketti antaa vinkkejä ja työkaluja ammattilaisille läheisten huomioimiseen.\n\nKoulutuksessa käsitellään seuraavia aiheita:\n\nLisäksi koulutuksessa kerrotaan FinFami-yhdistysten tarjoamasta tuesta ja pohditaan ammattilaisen ja vertaisomaisen työparityöskentelyä läheisen tukemiseksi, jossa esimerkkinä ",

Kuten sairastunut myös hänestä huolta kantava läheinen käy läpi omaa toipumisprosessiaan. Läheisen prosessin vaiheet voivat toistua eri järjestyksessä ja eri henkilöillä eri tavoin. Sairastuneen oireiden paheneminen voi aloittaa läheisen kohdalla prosessin uudelleen. Kuitenkin, jos sairaus kroonistuu, läheisen läpikäymät prosessin vaiheet nopeutuvat ja tilanteista voidaan toipua nopeammin.\n\n1. Hälytysvaihe\nHälytysvaiheessa sairaus on akuutissa vaiheessa, henkilö on juuri sairastunut tai hänen sairaudessaan on haastavampi vaihe, esim. psykoosi. Tällöin sairastuneen läheinen saattaa käydä läpi tunteiden kaaosta. Tunteisiin voi kuulua häpeää, syyllisyyttä ja vihaakin. Hälytysvaiheessa yleistä on, että läheinen pystyy harvoin vielä käsittelemään omia tunteitaan vaan joutuu työntämään ne sivuun ja keskittymään sairastuneen kokemukseen ja tilanteeseen. Usein tunteiden etualalla voi olla katkeruus tai kriittisyys joko yleisesti elämää kohtaan tai esim. hoitotahoa kohtaan. Tässä prosessin vaiheessa läheinen ei välttämättä pysty vastaanottamaan tai käsittelemään saamaansa tietoa. Esim. ammattihenkilökunnan antamat ohjeet eivät jää välttämättä mieleen.\n\n2.

Osallisuuden vaiheessa alun tunnelukot saattavat aueta, ja läheisellä saattaa olla mahdollisuus käsitellä myös omia tunteitaan ja ajatuksiaan. Alun äkillisen, kuormittavan tilanteen jälkeen uutta tilannetta voidaan pystyä tarkastelemaan eri näkökulmista. Mitä tämä tilanne tarkoittaa minulle? Voimavarojen vapautuminen: läheinen pystyy jälleen näkemään myös muita asioita elämässä, kun sairastavan akuutti vaihe on jo tasaantunut.\n\n3. Ymmärtämisen vaihe\nYmmärtämisen vaiheessa läheinen pystyy käsittelemään ammattitaholta saatua tietoa ja vertaisten kokemuksia omaksi hyödykseen. Läheisen käsitys tilanteesta saattaa muuttua realistisemmaksi. Tässä vaiheessa informaatiota pystytään käyttämään soveltaen oman itsen sekä sairastuneen tilanteen kannalta sopivalla tavalla.\n\n4. Voimaantuminen\nVoimaantumisen vaiheessa läheinen on hyväksynyt, että hänen läheisensä sairaus on osa elämää ja elämässä on sen lisäksi myös tilaa muille asioille. Asenteet ja arvot saattavat mennä uusiksi. Läheinen saattaa pohtia, mikä on tärkeää elämässä ja mikä on hyvää elämää. Voimaantumisvaiheessa omaksutaan uusia toimintakäytänteitä arkeen sekä sopeudutaan erilaiseen elämään. Voimaantumisvaiheessa läheinen saattaa haluta myös alkaa auttamaan ja tukemaan muita samassa tilanteessa eläviä.\n\n####",

Aina tähän ei pysty, tilanteet tapahtuvat päivän aikana nopeasti. Kumppanin kanssa voi olla riitaa, ystävän kanssa erimielisyyttä tai kadulla vastaantuleva pyöräilijä voi vaikuttaa tympääntyneeltä, ja tämä voi herättää meissä tunteita.

Voiko kiukun takana olla jotain muuta, kuten pelko? Ylireagoinko tapahtuneeseen? Voiko omaa tunnetta pysähtyä tarkastelemaan, mitä se todellisuudessa yrittää kertoa? Ja sitten vain olla sen tunteen kanssa kuin kohtaisi ystävän, joka haluaa kertoa jotain. Tämän voi tehdä vaikkapa illalla päivän päätteeksi.

Jännitys on hyvä esimerkki siitä, kun tunteet voivat ottaa vallan. Itse tilanne voi tuntua kamalalta, mutta itse asiassa todellista hätää ei ole.

Eräänä jouluna sain kauniin peltisen rasian, jonka sisällä oli yksittäin punaiseen folioon käärittyjä suklaapaloja. Nämä olivat minulle todella rakkaita. Vaalin aarretta kuin elämääkin suurempaa ihmettä, nautin palan silloin tällöin. Vielä juhannuksenakin oli noin puolet jäljellä.

Päivänä muistetaan läheisiä, joiden elämään toisen päihderiippuvuus vaikuttaa. Läheisillä on oikeus saada tukea omaan toipumiseensa ja rakentaa elämästään omannäköistään sekä itselleen merkityksellistä, muistuttaa yhdistyksemme vapaaehtoinen Susanna omalla tarinallaan.\n\nElämä on matka. Se rakentuu erilaisista vaiheista, joiden läpi eläminen voi tuntua välillä vaikealta, jopa selviytymistaistelulta. Koettelemukset ja kärsimys ovat tunteita, joita haluamme välttää. Näihin tuskallisimpiin hetkiin kuitenkin kätkeytyy avaimet elämän mysteeriin, salaisuuteen.\n\nPäihderiippuvuus on koko perheen sairaus, jota varjostavat valheet, manipulaatio, rajattomuus ja väkivalta. Kodin seinien sisäpuolelle kätkeytyy myrkyllisten ihmissuhteiden rihmasto, joka elää ainutlaatuista todellisuuttaan.\n\nAlkoholin käyttö on ollut laillista, sallittua, ja näin ollen luonnollinen osa suomalaista yhteiskuntaa ja kulttuuria. Valtaosa päihderiippuvuuteen liittyvistä ongelmista ei välity kodin seinien ulkopuolelle päivähoitoon, kouluun tai työelämään. Suurin osa suomalaisista alkoholisteista on työssäkäyviä. Kodin salaisuuksien signaalit ovat kuin savumerkkejä, mutta tuli ei näy. Näiden merkkien tunnistaminen ja niihin puuttuminen on vaikeaa myös ammattilaisi",

Näiden merkkien tunnistaminen ja niihin puuttuminen on vaikeaa myös ammattilaisille. Puheeksi ottaminen ei useinkaan auta, koska päihderiippuvuus on itsensä kieltävä sairaus. Perheen jaettu kokemus on syvään juurtunut häpeä, joka koskettaa sekä päihteitä käyttävää että läheisiä. Salaisuus jää pinnan alle.\n\nHoitamattomana päihderiippuvuus on etenevä, eskaloituva ja ennenaikaiseen hautaan johtava. Jos toinen vanhempi ei juo, hän yrittää peitellä enemmän tai vähemmän tietoisesti kumppaninsa juomista. Parisuhteen sisällä myrskyää. Lapset oppivat pienestä pitäen kirjoittamattomat säännöt, ja ovat lojaaleja vanhempiaan kohtaan. Käyttäytyi päihteitä käyttävä miten huonosti tahansa, kaikessa kamaluudessaan läheisten suojeluun pyrkivä operaatio pitää yllä toimintahäiriöitä.\n\n### Lapsuus päihderiippuvuuden keskellä\n\nKun huolta pitävä aikuinen käytti alkoholia, hän käyttäytyi monella tapaa myös väkivaltaisesti. Jäljet näkyivät kehossani, mutta elettiin aikaa, jolloin fyysinen kurittaminen oli sallittua ja perheen sisäinen asia. Ainoa tapani suojautua päihteiltä ja väkivallalta oli vajota mielikuvitusmaailmaan (dissosiaatio). Näihin maailmoihin pakeneminen oli suojautumis- ja selviytymiskeino, ja näin vältyin henkiseltä ja fyysiseltä kivulta. Kuoleman läsnäolo oli ehkä vaikeinta ymmärtää.\n\nVaikka mielikuvitusmaailmat olivat suojapaikka, ne olivat myös syy huolta pitävän",

Kuoleman läsnäolo oli ehkä vaikeinta ymmärtää.\n\nVaikka mielikuvitusmaailmat olivat suojapaikka, ne olivat myös syy huolta pitävän aikuisen väkivallalle. Noissa maailmoissa elin vallattomasti ja riehakkaasti, eli pidin liikaa ääntä. En voinut kuitenkaan luopua satujen maailmasta, koska olin temperamentiltani ja luonteeltani ulospäin suuntautunut, luova ja leikkisä. Se mitä olin (olen), oli (on) vaikea muuttaa.

Kun synnyin vuonna 1972, en ymmärtänyt, minkä keskelle synnyin. Sain kulkea pitkän matkan ja kokea kärsimystä ja menetyksiä, ennen kuin pääsin jyvälle, mistä on kysymys.

Elämää värittivät myös vakavat mielenterveyden häiriöt, väkivalta ja rikollisuus. Käsittelin pitkään lapsuuteni kaoottisuutta terapiassa, mutta se oli vasta intro. Rakensin elämäni taloon perustukset. Lapsuuteni mielenmaisemissa pikku-ukkoja näkevät alkoholistit olivat vielä pientä verrattuna myöhemmin näkökenttääni avartuvaan huumeita käyttävien maailmaan.

Havahduin erilaisten todellisuuksien illuusioon vasta marraskuussa 2018, jolloin kuopukseni teki päihdepsykoosissa itsemurhan. Osittain tämä johtui siitä, etteivät edes sosiaali- ja terveyspalvelujen ammattilaisetkaan ymmärtäneet päihderiippuvuutta ja sen dynamiikkaa perheessä. Toisaalta huumeiden käytön maailmassa näytökset episodeineen ovat moninkertaisesti nopeatempoisempia, traagisempia ja konkreettisempia. Päihderiippuvuuden ylisukupolvisuus lisää ongelman syvyyttä ja laajuutta.\n\nOlin myös auttamattoman sokea sille, että olin itsekin sairastunut läheisenä. Elin pelastajan illuusiossa ja pelko ohjasi elämääni, kontrolloin. Todellinen muutos lähti vasta kuopukseni kuolemasta. Se oli pakon sanelemaa. Kun istuin sairaalasängyn äärellä, ja seurasin, miten elämä hiipuu rakkaan lapseni maallisesta kehosta, oli päästettävä irti rakkaudella. Enää ei ollut vaihtoehtoja. Taas kerran, oli peili nostettava omiin käsiin, ja tarkastettava kurssia elämäni kartalla. Vasta tämän jälkeen aloin ymmärtää ja toipua. Päästin lopulta rakkaudella irti kaikista vahingollisista ihmissuhteista, erosin ja muutin toiselle paikkakunnalle. Aloin ottaa vastuun itsestäni ja elämästäni.

Aloin nähdä myös omat hyvät pyrkimykset uudesta kulmasta.\n\nNykyään kameleonttisuus on taito, ja olen varsin hyvä lukemaan erilaisia ihmisiä. Joskin liiallinen ymmärrys on loputon kaivo, johon olin alati hukkumassa, joten minun oli opeteltava vetämään myös rajat.”\n\nMoni ympärilläni pohti, miten minulle annettiin enemmän kuin jaksoin kantaa. Nyt tiedän vastauksen: tarvitsin kaikki kokemukset, jotta voisin luopua todellisuudesta, jossa elin. Lapsuuteni kokemukset huolta pitävien aikuisten toimesta valmistelivat ja antoivat hauraat eväät elämälle. Terapiaprosessissa rakensin perustan, joka osaltaan valmisteli minua vanhempana siihen, että kovemmat ajat olivat luvassa. Nyt, viisi ja puoli vuotta pojan kuoleman jälkeen, ymmärrän kokemusteni merkityksen. Alan päivä päivältä nousta jaloilleni.\n\nTunnen kiitollisuutta siitä, että vaikka en voi muuttaa mennyttä enkä pääse yli menneisyyden koettelemuksista, voin elää kuta kuinkin hyvää elämää kipeistä kokemuksista huolimatta. Olen voinut oppia ja kasvaa ulos uhrin asemasta omin jaloin seisovaksi naiseksi. Olen voinut antaa anteeksi itselleni ja muille. Menetin paljon. Jäljellä on rakkaus – ja elämisen sietämätön vimma.

Each session includes between 5 and 20 participants, depending on the space and number of registrations.\n\nPlease bring along, if possible, a blanket, yoga mat, warm socks, and a pillow for your comfort.\n\nSession dates and locations:\n\n26 Nov, 14:00–15:00 – Lausteen lähiötupa, Kirjurinkatu 3\n\n27 Nov, 12:45–13:45 – Panskis, Hyrköistentie 28\n\n10 Dec, 18:30–19:30 – Auralan Setlementti, Satakunnantie 10\n\n11 Dec, 13:00–14:00 – Nuorisotila Huudi, Gregorius IX:n tie 8\n\nFULL Maarian kylätalo\n\nRegister for the session time and location that suit you best through this link.\n\n### Kenelle?\n\nMielenterveys- ja päihdeläheisille.\n\n### Milloin?\n\nMarras- ja joulukuussa 2025.\n\n### Missä?\n\nLausteen lähiötuvalla, Panskiksessa, Auralan Setlementillä, Huudilla ja Maarian kylätalolla.\n\n##### Milla Roos\n\nToiminnanjohtaja\n\n044 793 0581\n[email protected]",

Tässä artikkelissa keskitymme Altin kokemuksiin, jotka heijastavat yhdistyksen merkitystä ja vaikutusta jäsentensä elämässä.\n\n### Mukaan toimintaan\n\nKun Alti ensimmäisen kerran kuuli V-S FinFamista, hän oli akuuttipsykiatrian poliklinikalla, joka nykyään tunnetaan mielialahäiriötyöryhmänä. Hän oli hakeutunut sinne henkilökohtaisen kriisin keskellä, kun hänen läheistensä tilanteet olivat kärjistyneet. Siellä hänelle kerrottiin Moip! -hankkeesta, joka oli suunnattu läheisen roolissa oleville nuorille aikuisille.\n\n### Yhteisön voima\n\nAlti kertoo, että V-S FinFamin toimintaan osallistuminen on antanut hänelle yhteisön, jossa hän ei ole yksin. Hän on kohdannut muita, joilla on samankaltaisia kokemuksia ja tämä on auttanut häntä ymmärtämään, ettei hän ole yksin ja toisilla on samankaltaisia kokemuksia. Tämä oivallus on ollut vapauttava ja voimaannuttava.\n\n### Monessa mukana\n\nAlti on osallistunut V-S FinFamin toimintaan monin tavoin. Hän on ollut mukana vertaistukiryhmissä, kouluttanut tulevia sosiaali- ja terveysalan ammattilaisia ja osallistunut erilaisiin projekteihin, jotka tukevat mielenterveysläheisten asemaa yhteiskunnassa.

Erityisesti hän mainitsee Prospect-psykoedukaatio vertaistukikurssin, joka on ollut hänelle merkittävä sekä osallistujana että ohjaajana.\n\n### Tärkeitä hetkiä\n\nYksi Altille erityisen mieleenpainuva hetki V-S FinFamin taipaleelta oli, kun hän sai mahdollisuuden puhua Berliinin Euroopan mielenterveyskonferenssissa. Tämä kokemus vahvisti hänen käsitystään siitä, kuinka tärkeää on jakaa oma tarina ja auttaa muita samassa tilanteessa olevia. Alti on nähnyt vuosien varrella, kuinka yhdistys on muuttunut ja ottanut enemmän huomioon myös nuorten aikuisten tarpeita ja näkökulmia. Tämä on ollut tärkeää myös hänen omalle sitoutumiselleen yhdistykseen.\n\n### Oma oivallus\n\nAlti kokee, että tärkein oppi V-S FinFamista on ollut ymmärrys siitä, että häpeästä voi vapautua. Kokemus siitä, että hänen ei tarvitse kantaa vastuuta läheistensä teoista on tuonut suurta helpotusta elämään.\n\n### Yhteisön voima\n\nV-S FinFami on tarjonnut Altille yhteisön, jossa hän on saanut tukea ja ymmärrystä. Tämä on saanut hänet pysymään yhdistyksen jäsenenä ja jatkamaan vapaaehtoistyötä. Hän haluaa olla mukana rakentamassa toivoa ja tukemassa muita, jotka kamppailevat mielenterveyden haasteiden kanssa. V-S FinFamin 40-vuotisjuhla onkin oiva hetki juhlistaa yhteisön voimaa ja sitä, kuinka yksilön elämä voi muuttua merkittäväs",

Jos leikkausten määrä nousee jo 60 prosenttiin, kyse ei ole enää talouden sopeuttamisesta vaan yhteisesti rakennetun järjestelmän romuttamisesta.\n\nJärjestöt ovat syntyneet ihmisten tarpeista: paikallisesti, yhteisöllisesti ja inhimillisesti. Niiden toiminnoissa ihmiset ja perheet kohdataan, kuunnellaan ja autetaan. Työtä tehdään ammattilaisten ja vapaaehtoisten voimin, rinnakkain julkisten palveluiden kanssa – ei päällekkäisesti.\n\nJärjestöissä ihmisten kannattelu, vakauttaminen ja kriisiauttaminen ovat arkea. Eikö juuri tässä ajassa tarvita mekanismeja ja rakenteita, jotka tuovat turvaa kansalaisten arkeen?\n\nSote-järjestöt ovat erittäin tarkasti valvottuja valtionavunsaajia ja niiden tuloksellisuutta seurataan tarkasti, taloudesta ja toiminnasta raportoidaan vuosittain sosiaali- ja terveysministeriön avustuskeskukselle (Stea). Taloudellisesti tuloksellisesta ja vaikuttavasta työstä huolimatta ollaan romuttamassa mekanismia, joka tukee heikoimmassa asemassa olevia, ehkäisee syrjäytymistä ja tuo ihmiset yhteen.\n\nMeidän mielestämme tämä on iso virhe!

Leikkaukset järjestöpuolella vaikuttavat välittömästi osaamisen karkaamisen vuoksi myös palvelutuotannon puolelle. Hyvinvointialueet ovat sitoutuneet siihen, että jos he eivät voi itse tuottaa sote-palveluja, he kilpailuttavat ja pyrkivät suosimaan monituottaja-lähtöistä toimintamallia. Jos järjestöt halvaannutetaan palvelutuotannosta, on se omiaan tukemaan mallia, jossa sote-palveluiden tuottaminen jatkossa keskittyy yhä harvemmalle tuottajalle. Tuskin tämäkään tulevaisuuden uhkakuva sote-kustannuksia tulevaisuudessa karsii?\n\nSote-järjestöt eivät ole kuluerä, vaan investointi hyvinvointiin. Ne ovat osa ratkaisua – ei ongelmaa.

Meistä lapsiomaisista puhutaan näkymättöminä lapsina, sillä opimme jo hyvin nuorena piilottamaan ja peittämään kodin seinien sisäpuolella vallitsevat murheet. Mutta me opimme myös hyvin nuorena piilottamaan itsemme kodin seinien sisäpuolella, vähintäänkin osia itsestämme, jotta emme olisi vaivaksi ja taakaksi. Jotta emme aiheuttaisi kuohuntaa.\n\nNiin opin itsekin. Opin sammuttamaan omia mielihalujani, osia itsestäni ja tunteitani. Ihan erityisesti opin piilottamaan sen osan itsestäni, jonka tiesin nostattavan kaikkein vahvimpia tunteita. Opin sulautumaan joukkoon, olemaan mahdollisimman normaali. Ja sitä kaavaa toteutin vielä pitkälle aikuisuuteen.\n\nTarvittiin useita vuosia hyväksyvää sosiaalista ilmapiiriä, terapiaa ja riittävän tasaista arkea, ennen kuin lapsuudessa ja nuoruudessa sammuttamani ja piilottamani asiat alkoivat heräillä, kaivautua pintaan. Heräsi kyky haaveilla ja toivoa, heräsi halu tavoitella jotain enemmän, kaivautui pintaan tunteet ja koko tunnemaailman kirjo, punoutui  yhteen keho-mieliyhteys – ja lopulta syttyi myös rohkeus hyväksyä itseni sellaisena kuin olen.\n\nKesäkuu on kansainvälisesti Pride-kuukausi, jolloin nostetaan erityisesti esiin sukupuoli- ja seksuaalivähemmistöjen oikeus ihmisarvoiseen, tasavertaiseen ja kunnioitettav",

Kuten olemme valitettavasti saaneet mediasta tänäkin vuonna lukea, kuukausi herättää vahvoja tunteita, jotka purkautuvat ilkivalta- ja väkivaltatekoina. Somessa ja mediassa erilaisilla foorumeilla päivitellään  tarvitseeko niitä seksuaali- ja sukupuolivähemmistöjen oikeuksia luukuttaa, siihen kuulumista tai vähemmistöjen tukemista rummuttaa ja työntää kaikkien kasvoille.\n\nKyllä pitää. Me päihde- ja mielenterveysläheiset tiedämme, miten tärkeää on tulla nähdyksi ja kuulluksi. Mutta mikä usein meidänkin puheista unohtuu on se, miten tärkeää on myös tulla hyväksytyksi – sellaisena kuin on. Ja niin kauan, kun tässä yhteiskunnassa kaikilla ei ole tasavertaista, ihmisarvoista ja kunnioitettavaa elämää, niin kauan kun tässä yhteiskunnassa sen jäsenet kokevat tarvetta piilottaa osan itsestään, todellisen minänsä, vähemmistöjen asemaa pitää puolustaa. Sateenkaarivähemmistöistä pitää puhua, sateenkaarivähemmistöillä on oma ääni, joka tulee kuulla ja sateenkaarivähemmistöillä on sama oikeus näkyä, kuin kaikilla muilla yhteiskuntamme jäsenillä.

Kollegan tuella kaikki sujui hienosti, ja iltapäivän aikana saimme kymmeniä nuoria pysähtymään messupisteellemme. Varsinais-Suomen mielenterveysomaiset FinFami ry osallistui myös syksyllä 2024 opiskelijatapahtumiin nostamaan esiin läheisteemaa, sillä huoli nuorista, joiden lähipiirissä on mielenterveyden tai päihteiden käytön haasteita, on suuri.\n\nMielenterveyden haasteet koskettavat yhä useampia meistä. Moni tuntee jonkun, jolla on mielenterveys- tai päihdehaasteita, ja näiden ongelmien tiedetään siirtyvän sukupolvelta toiselle. On tärkeää muistaa, että läheisen psyykkinen sairastuminen tai päihteiden väärinkäyttö vaikuttaa aina myös hänen lähipiiriinsä. Huoli itselle tärkeästä ihmisestä herättää paljon ajatuksia ja voi huomaamatta heijastua omaan jaksamiseen ja hyvinvointiin.\n\nPyysimme opiskelijoita täyttämään lyhyen kyselyn, jossa kartoitettiin heidän näkemyksiään aiheesta. Syksyn 2024 aikana saimme yli 600 vastausta. Kyselyn tulokset olivat seuraavia:\n\nRajojen asettaminen on erityisen haastavaa nuorille, jotka vasta hahmottelevat itsenäisyyttään ja määrittelevät omia rajojaan. Positiivinen havainto kyselyssä oli kuitenkin se, että vain 15 % vastaajista koki jäävänsä yksin huoliensa kanssa.\n\nVarsinais-Suomen FinFami ry:n Kysy nuorelta -hankke",

Hän kuuli yhdistyksestä ensimmäisen kerran lääkäriltään, joka suositteli häntä ottamaan yhteyttä yhdistykseen. Markku kertoo, että hän oli tuolloin epävarma ja hukassa läheisensä sairastuttua vakavasti. FinFami tarjosi hänelle tietoa ja tukea, jota hän kipeästi kaipasi.\n\n#### Osallistuminen ja saadut hyödyt\n\nMarkku päätyi mukaan V-S FinFamin toimintaan läheisensä sairauden myötä. Hän kertoo saaneensa yhdistykseltä ennen kaikkea tasavertaisuuden tunteen, joka oli hänelle arvokasta. ”Kun olin toiminut ja koulutuksessa ollut, oli helppo puhua. Siellä oli samalla viivalla kaikki” Markku muistelee.\n\n#### Aktiivinen panos yhdistyksessä\n\nMarkun aktiivisuus yhdistyksessä on ollut merkittävää. Hän on toiminut hallituksen jäsenenä, varapuheenjohtajana, tukihenkilönä ja vetänyt useita kursseja. Erityisesti tukihenkilötoiminta on ollut hänelle lähellä sydäntä: ”Haluan auttaa muita, koska olen saanut itse läheisen",

Tämä tunnustus oli hänelle merkityksellinen, sillä se osoitti hänen panoksensa yhdistykselle olevan arvostettua. Yhdistyksen muutokset vuosien varrella ovat olleet suuria. Markku on nähnyt, kuinka toiminta on laajentunut ja monipuolistunut.\n\n#### Oppi ja arvot\n\nMarkun suurin oivallus yhdistyksessä toimiessa on ollut yhteisön voima: ”Et ole yksin.” Tämä ajatus on vahvistanut hänen käsitystään siitä, että vertaistuki ja yhteisöllisyys ovat korvaamattomia. Hän on oppinut, että jakamalla tietoa ja kokemuksia voi auttaa muita.\n\n#### Miksi pysyä mukana?\n\nMarkku on saanut yhdistykseltä paljon. Markku pysyy yhdistyksen jäsenenä koska yhteisön tarjoama tuki ja ystävyyssuhteet ovat korvaamattomia. V-S FinFamin 40-vuotisjuhla ei ole vain juhlaa menneestä, vaan myös kiitos aktiivisille jäsenille kuten Markulle, joiden panos on muovannut yhdistystä vuosikymmenten ajan.

Yksi merkitys sanalla on ryhmä ihmisiä, jotka pyrkivät yhdessä parantamaan elinolojaan.\n\nYhteiskunta on iso yhteisö, jossa soisi tämän määritelmän toteutuvan. Valitettavasti näin ei kuitenkaan ole. Nykypäivänä yhteiskuntamme on yhä polarisoituneempi. Kohtaamme jatkuvasti kokemuksia sekä tapahtumia erilaisista ääripäistä, jotka pyrkivät sysäämään meitä keskenämme eriarvoiseen asemaan, repien monin paikoin yhteisöämme.\n\nVahva yhteisö antaa turvaa ja pitää huolta heikoimmistaan. Vahva yhteisö tunnistaa erilaisuudet vahvuudeksi ja mahdollisuuksiksi. Yhteisöt ovat aina arvokkaita sen jäsenilleen. Mutta kun yhteiskuntamme epäonnistuu olemaan vahva yhteisö, nousee muiden yhteisöjen rooli entistä suurempaan arvoon. Näin on myös sateenkaariyhteisön kohdalla.\n\nTurku Priden tämän vuoden teemana on yhteisö. Käsillä olevassa polarisoituneessa ajassa on entistä tärkeämpää muodostaa vahvoja yhteisöjä yhteiskuntamme sisällä. Yhteisöjä, jotka vastustavat syrjintää ja eriarvoisuutta. Jotka puolustavat yhdenvertaisuutta sekä kaikille turvallista yhteiskuntaa. Yhteisöjä, jotka antavat toivoa, että ääripäiden sijaan osaamme ja pystymme luomaan yhtenäisempää sekä yhdenvertaista yhteiskuntaa.

Serene-toiminta on pakolaistaustaisille maahanmuuttajille suunnattu toimintamuoto. Serene käynnistyi kehittämishankkeena 2012-2016 ja jatkaa vuoden 2017 alusta Serene-toimintana. Koski on seksuaaliväkivaltatyön työmuoto, joka on alkanut vuonna 2016 kehittämishankkeena. Alun perin hankkeena alkanut, sittemmin toimintamuodoksi vakiintunut Feeniks-työ, on läheisen menettäneille suunnattu työmuoto. Vuosina 2020-2023 toteutettiin MIELItietty-hanke, jossa kehitettiin parikriisityötä.\n\n### Haluatko liittyä jäseneksi?\n\nVoit tukea toimintaamme ja edistää Lounais-Suomen alueella mielen hyvinvointia liittymällä jäseneksemme.\n\n### Haluatko tukea toimintaamme?\n\nOlemme erittäin iloisia ja kiitollisia kaikista meille ohjatuista lahjoituksista!
