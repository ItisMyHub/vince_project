Human rights were written by the UN, the United Nations. These are texts that encourage all the countries in the world to take responsibility for ensuring that everyone can live a good life. These are not laws, but many of these texts have been signed by a lot of countries, who have promised to abide by them.

There are also laws that state that human rights must be respected. The law that applies in Europe is the European Convention. The European Convention is a law in Sweden.

The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is also a law in Sweden. The convention contains human rights for children under the age of 18.   

All laws and decisions in Sweden must be in accordance with the European Convention and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Discrimination means that you are treated worse than others based on your gender, religion, age, sexual orientation or because of where you come from. It is also discrimination if you are treated worse than others because, for instance, you are in a wheelchair or are visually impaired, or because you feel that your gender doesn’t match your body. It is illegal to discriminate against anyone.
