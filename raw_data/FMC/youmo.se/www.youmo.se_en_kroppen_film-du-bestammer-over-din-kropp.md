### Human rights

Human rights protect your right to live a good life. You have the right to education and health care. You have the right to be treated fairly and the right to flee to another country if you are in danger.

### Masturbation

Masturbation means that you have sex with yourself. For instance, you might caress your sexual organ or other parts of your body. It’s not bad to masturbate. You decide yourself if you want to do it.
