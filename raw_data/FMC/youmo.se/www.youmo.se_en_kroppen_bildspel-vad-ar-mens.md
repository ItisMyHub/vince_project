This slide show will explain what happens in your body when you get your period. 

Girls are born with a large number of egg cells. Every month, an egg cell matures into an egg. This process begins when you enter puberty and continues until you reach menopause. Eggs are formed in the ovaries.

It takes about two weeks for an egg to mature. While this is happening, the womb is preparing itself to be able to receive a fertilized egg.

When an egg has matured, it loosens from the ovary and goes to the Fallopian tube.

The week before their period some women get what is called PMS. You might feel sad or angry. You might also feel energetic or want to eat sweets. Some women get more pimples. Your breasts might also feel tender.

If the egg isn’t fertilized by sperm, blood will leave the womb and come out through the vagina. This is what is called a menstrual period.

It is common to have cramps in your stomach or back before your period starts. Some women have a lot of pain, but menstrual cramps are not dangerous.  

When your period is over, everything starts over again from the beginning, and a new egg matures in the ovaries.
