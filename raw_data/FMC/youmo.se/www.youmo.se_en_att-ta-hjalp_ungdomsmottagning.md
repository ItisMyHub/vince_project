A Youth Guidance Centre is a clinic for adolescents and young adults, where you can get help with many different things. You can visit the clinic from when you are 12 or 13 years of age until you are between 20 and 25 years of age. Each clinic is different. Here are examples of the types of help you can get:

Most Youth Guidance Centres offer free condoms.

## How much does it cost to visit a Youth Guidance Centre?

If you are under 18 years of age, you do not pay anything. At most clinics, you do not pay anything if you are over 18 years of age, either. At some clinics, a visit costs the same as a visit to a health clinic.

When you are given a prescription for birth control or other medication, you pay for this when you collect the medication from a pharmacy. A prescription is a message from the clinic to the pharmacy.

At many Youth Guidance Centres, birth control is free, although, not at all of them.

## What do I do if I want to visit a Youth Guidance Centre?

You have the freedom to go to the Youth Guidance Centre of your choice in Sweden. It is common to call and make an appointment beforehand. Many clinics also have specific times during the week where you can visit without having made an appointment. This is called drop-in.

## Who should I see?

A mix of people from different professions work at the Youth Guidance Centres. Midwives and counsellors are available at each Centre and there is nearly always a doctor available. 

You do not need to know who you are going to meet with when visiting a Centre. The first person you talk to will help you figure this out.

Everyone who works in health care is subject to confidentiality. None of the people who work at the Centre are allowed to say that you have been there or what you have said.
