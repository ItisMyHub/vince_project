## Question

I wonder how you meet someone in order to have sex with them? Everyone else seems to be having sex. I’ve never met anyone who wants to.

## Answer

Many other people wonder about this, too.

It’s very easy to believe that everyone else is having sex. Sometimes there’s a lot of talk about sex. However, the reality can be different. What is most important is to not have sex until both people want to.

If you walk up to a person and ask them if they want to have sex, probably nobody will say yes. Most people want to get to know each other first. Feeling ready to have sex can also be very different for different people. Usually you would have been in a relationship for a while.

Is there someone you like very much? If so, it could be a good idea to try to get to know them better. Try and carefully find out if they are interested in you. You could begin by talking about normal things and show them that you care. For instance, ask them how they are, or whether they like school or work.

If the person seems happy talking to you, then you might ask them if they want to do something together with you. You could, for instance, meet for coffee or take a walk.

You can get to know new people in many ways, for example, at school or through friends. Or you could join an association or a club that has an activity you like. Then you can get to know someone who shares your interests.
