### Ministry for Foreign Affairs Hotline, (UD-jouren) Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Sweden

Call the Ministry for Foreign Affairs Hotline (UD-jouren) if someone has forced you to go abroad and you need help to get home. The Hotline is open 24 hours a day. Phone number: +46 (0)8 405 50 05

### Social Services (Socialtjänsten)

Contact Social Services if you are afraid that something will happen to you, or if you need support or protection from threats or violence. They can help you. For example, they can organise a safe place for you to stay temporarily. 

You can find contact details for Social Services on your municipality’s website. You can also get help to contact Social Services, for example from the organisations listed above.

When you ask Social Services for help, you need to tell them who you are. If you are worried that your family might harm you if they find out you have asked for help, let Social Services know this. That way, they can find a safe place for you before they contact your parents or the adults you live with. 

Social Services has to contact the adults you live with if you are under 18 years old. But they do not always have to tell them everything you have said. Some things can sometimes be kept secret, for example if there is a risk that your family would harm you if they found out. 

### 112 and the police

Call 112 if you are in danger and urgently need help. Call the police on 114 14 if it is not an emergency, or +46 77 114 14 if you are outside of Sweden.

### Can my family decide everything about my life?

Your parents or legal guardians have responsibility for you until you reach the age of 18. But they aren’t allowed to decide everything. You have the right to be present and make decisions that affect your life. Get help from someone else if you feel that your family wants to decide on or control your life.
