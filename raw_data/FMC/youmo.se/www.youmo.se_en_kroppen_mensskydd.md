## Sanitary pad

A sanitary pad absorbs blood. You wear the pad in your underpants. On one side is an adhesive strip that holds the pad in place. There are different sizes. Most girls need to change pads more often during the first days of their period. A pad may begin to smell or leak if you wear it too long.

## Panty liner

A panty liner is like a sanitary pad but smaller. You can use it at the end of your period when there is only a little blood. Some girls wear a panty liner when they use a tampon to avoid getting blood in their underpants if the tampon becomes full. 

## Tampon

You insert a tampon into the vagina. It absorbs blood so that it doesn’t leak. You can go swimming and do sports with a tampon.

There are different sizes of tampon. Choose a larger tampon if you bleed a lot. You can use a tampon even if you have never had sexual intercourse.

### How to insert a tampon

The first time you try a tampon, do so when you are bleeding heavily since it is easier to insert. Choose a small tampon. It can be easier if you squat a little with your legs spread apart.

### How often should I change tampons?

Change the tampon when you think that it may be full of blood. It slides out easily when you pull the string. If it is stuck, then it is probably dry and doesn’t need to be changed.

When you pull the tampon out, roll it in toilet paper and throw it in the wastebasket. 

You can leave a tampon in at night. Insert it before you go to sleep and change it as soon as you wake up. You can swim with a tampon. Change the tampon when you are finished.

### Can a tampon get stuck?

Being unable to remove a tampon is very uncommon. Squat and insert a finger. Grab the string or the tampon and pull. You can get help from a midwife at a youth guidance centre (ungdomsmottagning) if you cannot remove a tampon.

## Menstrual cup

A menstrual cup is made of soft rubber and can last for many years.

You insert it into the vagina and the blood flows into the cup. A menstrual cup holds more blood than a sanitary pad or a tampon.

You can swim with a menstrual cup.

### How to use a menstrual cup

The wide end goes in first. It can be easier if you squat a little with your legs spread apart.

You should be able to feel the stem with your finger, but it should not stick out.

### Removing, emptying and storing the menstrual cup

To remove it, pull the stem. You can empty the blood into the toilet.

It is usually enough to empty the sanitary protection cup about twice a day. But you may need to empty it more often during the first few days of your period if you bleed a lot.

Wash the cup with cold or hot water before reinserting it. 

Wash the cup with soap and water once your period is over. Then boil it in water for five minutes. Store it in a cloth bag or in an airy place, such as the bathroom cabinet.

### Youth Guidance Centre

You can visit a Youth Guidance Centre if you have questions about your body, sex or birth control. You can also visit the clinic if you are feeling anxious or depressed and need someone to talk to.
