## Questions and answers about reporting to us

You can report companies and products that do not comply with consumer rights legislation.

#### Marketing

Marketing is what a company says about its product or service. Examples include ads on the internet, TV, radio or in newspapers. You can report if you think a company's marketing is incorrect. You can also report if you think a company has an unfair sales method.

Examples of when you can report:

#### Contract terms

You enter into a contract when you buy something, sign up for a subscription, order tickets or book a hotel room. The terms of the contract must be reasonable. A contract must not include terms that do not comply with the Consumer Sales Act or other laws that protect you as a consumer. These are called unfair contract terms. You can report these to us.

Examples of when you can report:

An exception is when you buy from a private individual. Then the Sales of Goods Act applies, and you and the seller agree on the terms yourselves.

#### Price information

You must receive correct and clear information about the price. You can report if the price information is incorrect or lacking. Examples include when the price is shown without VAT, or when the comparison price is missing.

You can also report if the company states a reduced price without informing about the previous price.

#### Spam and junk mail

Companies are not allowed to send advertisements via email or SMS that you have not approved. Such advertisements are called spam or junk mail. You can report if you receive spam or junk mail.

#### Lack of safety for goods and services

A good or service is safe if it does not pose any risk, or only a low risk, to your health and safety when used normally. You can report goods and services that are not safe.

Examples of what you can report:

#### Travel rights

You can report if your rights were not respected during a journey. You can report journeys by plane, boat, bus, train, taxi, tram or underground. You can also report package travels, language trips and travel agency services.

You can also report if you have not received information about your rights in a form that is accessible to you, even though you have asked for it.

#### Difficulties using a travel company's website or app

You can report if you discover accessibility issues on an airline, train, bus, or ferry company's website, app, or ticket. Examples of issues might include text not working with screen readers or being difficult to navigate.

We register your report in our official records. You will not receive personal help after sending your report.

We review reports about dangerous goods or services. We assess whether to open a supervision case or not.

Reports about other issues may lead to a supervision case. You who made the report does not take part in the case.

#### How we work

We can start a supervisory case when we learn about a problem that has significant importance for many consumers. We can receive information about the problem in many ways. Reports are one way. It may also come through contact with other authorities or from external monitoring and analysis.

##### 1. We prioritise

We focus on the problems that are most urgent for consumers. We investigate how much consumer harm a certain business practice causes or can cause.

You will not be informed whether your report led to a supervision case or not.

##### 2. We contact the company

When we have opened a supervisory case, we inform the company about the suspected violation. The company must respond on how they will rectify the problem.

Sometimes we need more information from the company before we can decide if a violation has occurred.

##### 3. We close the case or hand it over to the Consumer Ombudsman

We close the case if the company agrees to rectify the problem or makes sure the good or service is safe. We may also close the case if the company responds, and we find they have done nothing wrong.

In cases concerning the safety of goods and services, we can order companies to rectify the deficiencies. In extreme cases, we can prohibit a company from selling a certain product or service. Companies can also receive a penalty fee for violations.

Other cases where we do not reach an agreement with the company can be referred to the Consumer Ombudsman. Consumer Ombudsman can issue a prohibition order or an order to provide information. Consumer Ombudsman can also take the case to court.
