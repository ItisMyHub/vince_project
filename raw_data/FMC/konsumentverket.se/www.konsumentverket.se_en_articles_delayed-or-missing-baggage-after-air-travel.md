## Keep this in mind if your luggage is delayed or missing

Report that your baggage has not arrived immediately in the arrival hall. Make sure you fill out a claim form, known as a Property Irregularity Report (PIR), together with a representative from the airport or airline.

Send your compensation claims to the airline as soon as possible.

## Find out your rights and make a claim

When your baggage does not arrive, it is important to report it immediately at the baggage claim. Make sure you fill out a report form, known as a Property Irregularity Report (PIR), together with a representative from the airport or airline. The report will serve as your proof that the baggage did not arrive.

If you have not reported the missing baggage, it may be difficult to claim compensation, as airlines usually assume that the baggage has arrived and been collected. In such cases, you will likely need some other type of documentation to prove that the baggage did not arrive to claim compensation from the airline.

#### Save receipts for all purchases

You may be entitled to make necessary purchases if your baggage is delayed or missing. Keep all receipts for what you buy. This could include items such as clothing or toiletries.

#### Send you claim to the airline as soon as possible

To claim compensation, you need to submit your claim to the airline in writing. For example, you can send an email. Include the receipts.

If your baggage was delayed but you have received it, you must send the claim within 21 days from the date you received the baggage.

When your baggage gets delayed or missing during air travel, you may have a right to compensation. With our free tool, the Flight Calculator, you answer questions about your travel to find out what rights you have and if you can claim compensation. The Flight Calculator also guides you further to the website of the airline in question so that you can send in your demand.

Send the claim to the airline as soon as possible. If it concerns delayed baggage that you have received, you must submit the claim within 21 days from the date you got your baggage back.

Have you travelled with multiple airlines? In that case, you can choose to send the claim to the airline that operated the first or the last leg of the flight.

#### Send the claim to the airline via email or letter

If you can not submit the claim via the airline's website, you can send it via email or letter instead. The important thing is that you complain in writing. Find the airline's contact information on their website. If you don’t have the contact details for the airline, you can check the terms and conditions on the airline’s website. Sometimes the contact details are listed there.

Your claim should include:

Save a copy of the claims you send to the airline.

You are entitled to compensation for expenses incurred due to delayed baggage. This can include costs for clothing or other items you need to purchase while waiting for your baggage. The airline’s liability for delayed baggage is limited to 1,519 SDR (approximately 21,800 SEK) per passenger. Keep in mind that you must minimize your expenses. If you purchase more than necessary or choose the most expensive option, you may not receive full compensation.

##### File a complaint as soon as possible

If your baggage is delayed, you need to file a complaint and make a claim to the airline as soon as possible. You must file the complaint within 21 days from the date you received your baggage.

##### Sometimes you receive half the amount

Often, airlines offer only 50 percent compensation for clothing you needed to buy due to delayed baggage. This is because you will likely use the clothing when you return home.

##### Situations where the airline is not required to compensate you

The airline does not have to compensate you if it has done everything reasonably possible to avoid you incurring costs. Even in cases where it was impossible for the airline to take such measures, they do not have to pay compensation. There are no specific situations where the airline is always free from liability. If the airline denies your claim, an assessment needs to be made in your specific case.

##### Sometimes you can get compensation through insurance

Contact your insurance company to see if you can get compensation for the baggage through your home insurance or travel insurance.

If you have paid for the travel with a card, you may also have an extra travel insurance through the card issuer. Check what applies with the card issuer. Compensation can be paid out from several companies. So, if you have several travel insurance policies, such as through both home insurance and a bank card, you can send a claim report to both companies.

If any of the following situations occur, you can claim compensation for the value of your baggage:

##### It is important to send your claims to the airline as soon as possible.

If you receive your baggage after 21 days and have not yet received compensation for the contents, the airline only needs to compensate you for the additional costs incurred.

##### Amount of compensation

The airline’s liability for lost baggage is limited to 1,519 SDR (approximately 21,800 SEK) per passenger. To be entitled to more compensation, you must have declared that your baggage is of higher value when checking it in. If you make such a “special declaration”, you can receive higher compensation if the baggage is lost. In this case, the amount you specified to the airline will apply. The airline may charge you a fee for making a “special declaration".

##### Cases where the airline does not have to compensate you

The airline does not have to compensate you if it can show that you caused the baggage to be lost. Compensation may also be reduced if you contributed to the loss.

Some airlines have conditions that limit what you can pack in checked baggage. This can include valuables, keys, business documents, certain electronics, and valuables. These conditions can also limit what you can claim compensation for if the baggage is lost.

##### Sometimes you can get compensation through insurance

Contact your insurance company to see if you can get compensation for the baggage through your home insurance or travel insurance.

If you have paid for your travel with a card, you may also have an extra travel insurance through the card issuer. Check what applies with the card issuer. Compensation can be paid out from several companies.

#### Contact the National Board for Consumer Disputes

If you and the company cannot reach an agreement, you can file a complaint to the public authority the National Board for Consumer Disputes (ARN).

ARN will assess your case and make a recommendation on how to resolve the dispute. Most companies follow ARN’s recommendations.

A normal processing time is approximately six months.

##### What does it cost to file a complaint with ARN?

It costs SEK 150 to file a complaint with ARN. When you submit your complaint, you can request that the company compensates you for the cost if ARN makes a recommendation in your favour.

###### If you need help with your complaint

Sometimes, the municipal consumer advisors can assist you in making a complaint to ARN.

#### Settle the dispute in court

If you have gone through the steps in this process but still have a dispute with the company, you can take the dispute to court. In that case, you should contact the district court (tingsrätten). It costs money to submit a complaint to court.

Are you unsure whether you should go to court or do you need help with your case? Then you can seek assistance from a lawyer.

Before seeking legal assistance, you can contact your insurance company. Many home insurance policies include what is called legal protection. It can cover certain costs associated with legal proceedings.

##### How much does it cost?

For a dispute involving a claim of up to 28,650 Swedish kronor (half a price base amount in 2024), known as a simplified litigation or small claim, the application fee is 900 kronor.

If the claim exceeds 28,650 kronor, or if the dispute does not concern a specific amount, the application fee is 2,800 kronor.

If you lose the dispute, you may be required to pay both your and the company's legal costs. However, in small claims, the costs you may have to pay are limited.
