The registration of your right of residence is valid until further notice. You will not have to extend the validity of the registration. When you have resided legally in Finland for a continuous period of 5 years, you have the right of permanent residence.

If you have registered your right of residence earlier and you now need a copy of the original registration certificate, please submit a certificate request to the Finnish Immigration Service.

You can watch our instructional video which shows how you can apply for the registration of an EU citizen's right of residence in the Enter Finland online service. The video will explain what the requirements for EU registration are, and what is your right to work during the EU registration process. It will also explain how you can get a permanent address in Finland. You can find the video on our Youtube channel: How to register an EU citizen's right of residence (youtube.com).

### Make sure you meet the following requirements:

You are in Finland as:

- an employee;
- a self-employed person;
- a student; or
- a family member of an EU citizen.
- If you apply for EU registration as a family member of a Finnish citizen, your family member must have exercised his or her right of free movement. Your Finnish family member must have lived in an EU Member State other than Finland, or in a country comparable to EU Member States, for at least 3 months.
If none of these grounds are applicable to you, you may still stay in Finland as long as you have sufficient financial resources to support yourself and your family members.

It is possible that more than one of these grounds are applicable to you during your stay in Finland. Even if your grounds for residence change, you do not need to renew your EU registration.

- If you apply for EU registration on the basis of sufficient financial resources, you are not required to have a specific amount of money. However, you must have enough funds to support yourself and your family members. Social assistance, for example, must not be your principal means of support. When assessing whether or not your financial resources are sufficient, the Finnish Immigration Service will consider your personal circumstances.
- Different grounds for residence have different requirements when it comes to financial resources.
- See the section "Attachments" for a list of what documents are required for your grounds for residence.
### Make sure you have all the attachments needed:

If you are an employee, attach to your application the following documents:

- Employment contract or other document issued by your employer as proof of a valid employment relationship.
- You can also attach, for example, the following documents: 
If you are self-employed, attach to your application the following documents:

- Documents as proof of self-employment, for example: 
If you are self-employed without your own company (‘kevytyrittäjä’ in Finnish), meaning that you use an invoicing service company to send invoices to your customers, attach the following documents to your application:

- Documents as proof of having started self-employment without your own company (that is, proof of working as a ‘kevytyrittäjä’ through an invoicing service company), for example:
If you are unemployed, attach to your application the following documents:

- If your employment relationship or self-employment has ended or you have become incapable for work, attach documents as proof of this to your application.
- Depending on your situation, you can submit, for instance, the following attachments:
If you are a student, attach to your application the following documents:

- documents as proof of your studies, for example: 
- assurance of having sufficient financial resources for yourself and for your family members.
If you apply for EU registration on the basis of studies, you can be registered only after your studies have started.

Your student place is verified from a certificate of attendance. An admission letter is not considered a sufficient attachment. Instead of a certificate of attendance, you can enter your national learner ID in the format 1.2.246.562.24.___________.

If you are a spouse, attach to your application the following documents:

- document on family ties. It can be, for instance, a marriage certificate or some other document that proves your family ties.
- If you have been divorced, your spouse has died or your spouse has moved away from Finland, attach to your application evidence of the grounds on which you have resided in Finland since then.

If you apply for EU registration for your child, attach the following documents to the application:

- document on family ties, such as a birth certificate or some other document that proves your family ties.
- information about the child’s other parent or guardian if this other parent or guardian is not your spouse or cohabiting partner:
If you are a dependent parent, attach the following documents to your application:

- evidence of being dependent on someone. This could be, for instance, a document regarding your health, your need of assistance and the financial support you are getting from your family member. You can also submit evidence of having lived together with your family member in your country of departure. 
- document on family ties.
If you are some other relative, attach the following documents to your application:

- evidence of being dependent on someone. This could be, for instance, a document regarding your health, your need of assistance and the financial support you are getting from your relative. You can also submit evidence of having lived together with your relative in your country of departure.
- document on family ties. 
If you apply for EU registration on the basis of sufficient financial resources, attach to your application the following documents:

- evidence of having sufficient financial resources for yourself and your family members, for example:

- evidence of property. 
- some of your most recent bank statements.

The money you get from your sponsor must be at your disposal. In addition, submit documents that will help us assess the sponsorship, for instance:
You must present the original documents when you visit the service point. If the documents are not in Finnish, Swedish or English, they must be accompanied by a translation into one of these languages made by an authorised translator.

A document that has been issued by an authority in an EU Member State concerning birth, marriage, registered partnership or death does not need to be translated, if you attach to the document a multilingual standard form issued by the authority.

### Apply for the EU registration:

Fill in the application in our online service Enter Finland.

If you cannot use Enter Finland, fill in a paper application. You will find a link to the application at the bottom of this page.

You can only apply for the registration when you are in Finland. You cannot apply for the registration of your right of residence before you have moved to Finland on a permanent basis. 

You need to fill in and submit the application yourself. Your employer or family member, for example, cannot apply for the registration on your behalf. However, you can submit an application on behalf of your child.

If you submit an online application in Enter Finland, pay the processing fee: 

If you submit a paper application, pay the processing fee at a service point of the Finnish Immigration Service.

Book an appointment in our appointment system (migri.vihta.com) to visit a service point of the Finnish Immigration Service.

When you visit the service point, bring with you:

- your valid passport or identity card
- originals and copies of the documents that you attach to your application 
Read more on the page Book an appointment at a service point in advance.

As an EU citizen, you will be issued with a registration certificate once you have presented sufficient evidence of meeting the requirements for registration.

If you have applied online, you can log in to Enter Finland and supplement your application there. 

If you have submitted a paper application, you can supplement it by post or by bringing additional documents to a service point of the Finnish Immigration Service during opening hours. For more information, see the page Notify us of changes.

You may cancel your application at any time during its processing. In that case, the application fee will usually not be refunded.

If you meet the requirements for registration and have presented the necessary attachments, you can get a registration certificate immediately when you visit a service point to prove your identity. You will be given a paper certificate that contains your name and address as well as the date of registration.

If you cannot get a decision immediately due to missing attachments, you will get the registration certificate later into your Enter Finland account or by post.

If you wish to obtain a Finnish identity card, you can apply for one from the police after the Finnish Immigration Service has registered your right of residence. For information on how to apply for an identity card, see the website of the Finnish police (poliisi.fi). If you wish to obtain a municipality of residence and a permanent address, please contact the Digital and Population Data Services Agency (dvv.fi).

If you are not satisfied with the decision, you have a statutory right to appeal against the decision to an administrative court. Instructions on how to appeal are attached to the decision. 

The majority of decisions made by administrative courts are subject to a fee. For more information about court fees in administrative courts, see the website for Finnish courts (oikeus.fi).
