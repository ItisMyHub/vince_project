### Prepare:

1. You need to be able to support yourself in Finland for the entire duration of your studies. You must have at least EUR 800 at your disposal every month to be able to pay for your accommodation, food and other needs. 

- Add to your application proof of how you will finance your stay in Finland during the first year of studies. 
- If your studies will take less than one year, you must have 800 euros per month at your disposal.
- If you will pay the tuition fee at a later stage, you must have the money for the tuition fee in your bank account when you submit the residence permit application.
If your educational institution supports your living in Finland, you do not necessarily need to have 800 euros per month at your disposal. Attach to your application documentation of the support your educational institution provides. Read more on the page Income requirement for students.

2. You have a study place

You can get a residence permit if you have been accepted to study at an educational institution in Finland. Your studies must lead to a vocational qualification or a degree. You may also get a residence permit for other types of studies if you have a well-founded reason for it. You cannot get a residence permit for studies to complete basic education. Read more on the page Study place.

3. You have insurance

As a student, you must personally cover the costs if you become ill in Finland. In order to get a residence permit, you must take out private insurance that will cover your medical and pharmaceutical expenses.

If you have a Kela card, a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) or a UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) you do not need to take out other insurance. Read more about the insurance you need, and about accepted insurance companies, on the page Insurance.

### D-visa for students

You can apply for a 100-day D visa at the same time as you apply for a residence permit. The D visa allows you to travel to Finland immediately after you have been issued with a residence permit and a D visa sticker has been attached to your passport. You should apply for a D visa only if you can travel to Finland within 2 weeks of being granted a residence permit, because you need to collect your residence permit card from a collection point in Finland. Read more on the page D visa.

## Right to work when you have been granted a residence permit for studies

If you have been granted a residence permit for studies, you are allowed to work in paid employment in any field for an average of 30 hours per week. The number of working hours can be exceeded some weeks, as long as the average working hours are no more than 30 hours per week at the end of the year.

In other words, you may work for an average of 120 hours per month or a total of 1,560 hours per year.

If your degree requires completing internships or a diploma work, the working time restrictions do not apply to them. In other words, the weekly 30-hour limit is not applied to them if it has been agreed already while making the agreement that you will earn credits from them. If the work is registered afterwards as an internship included in your studies, the 30-hour limit will apply.

Your employer checks how many hours your residence permit allows you to work. Both you and your employer are responsible for ensuring that the maximum number of hours is not exceeded. The authority responsible for overseeing working times is the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (tyosuojelu.fi).

If your residence permit was granted before the legislative amendments that entered into force on 15 April 2022, you have the same right to work as those who have a new residence permit. In other words, you may work for 30 hours per week on average.

## Your residence permit can be either an A permit or a B permit

If you are coming to Finland to pursue a higher education degree, you will be granted an A permit, that is, a continuous residence permit.

If you are coming to Finland to pursue a degree other than a higher education degree, you will be granted a B permit, that is, a temporary residence permit. B permits are also granted to exchange students.

## Prepare for your life in Finland

Among other things, the authorities may ask you for information about whether you have enough money to live in Finland.

If you were not issued a personal identity code together with your residence permit card, you must visit a service location of the Digital and Population Data Services Agency in person.

The Digital and Population Data Services Agency enters your personal details, information about your family relations and your address in the Population Information System. You can also apply for a municipality of residence at the Digital and Population Data Services Agency.
