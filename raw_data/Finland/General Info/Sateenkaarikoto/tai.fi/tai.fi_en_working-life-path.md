# Working Life Path

The working life path is particularly suitable for those who learn best by doing and in working life. The path is also suitable for those who already have a lot of expertise in the field or who have completed another vocational qualification, or you already have a job in the field.

In working life path, learning is largely realised at the workplace. At the workplace, you can study one or more units or the entire qualification.

## On-the-job learning

In working life path, you plan the path together with the teacher.  What to do at the workplace is agreed together.

You can acquire the required competence either entirely through an apprenticeship or a training agreement or by combining them flexibly. A precondition for concluding an apprenticeship and training agreement is that the workplace has sufficient production and service activities, the necessary tools and personnel with competent professional skills, training and work experience. A responsible workplace instructor is appointed from the workplace.

## Apprenticeship training

In apprenticeship training, you mainly acquire competence related to the qualification or unit you have completed at the workplace in practical tasks. Apprenticeship training is based on a fixed-term employment contract between the employer and you, in which case salary is also paid for it. During the apprenticeship, the teachers of the Turku Vocational Institute act as instructors of on-the-job learning and assessors of demonstrations.

## Training agreement

In the training agreement, you are not in an employment relationship, in which case you will also not be paid salary or other compensation. The training agreement is made in writing for a unit or a smaller unit. The training agreement is made between the educational institution and the workplace representative, and you will be notified of the agreement.
