## Arriving to Turku​

Turku is located on the South-Western coast of Finland. Our city is easy to reach by public transportation from all the other major cities in Finland. Turku is about two hours away from both Helsinki and Tampere. You can arrive to Turku by air, sea, rails and roads.​

- For instructions on arriving to and getting around in Turku, go to the VisitTurku website.​
The Turku public transportation is called Föli. Most bus lines start, end or pass through the city center.​

- Info on Föli timetables, fares and bus cards can be found on the Föli website.
Föli has its own transit app, but Google maps will also find Föli routes to where you want to go.
