# Labour market training

Vocational labour market training is primarily for adults who are unemployed or at risk of unemployment.

Labour market training is free of charge. During the training, the student receives an unemployment benefit and compensation for expenses. For additional information on labour market training and the related benefits, go to Job Market.

You can find all open labour market training options on the TE Services website.
