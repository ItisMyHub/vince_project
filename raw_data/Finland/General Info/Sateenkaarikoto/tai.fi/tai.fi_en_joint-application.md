## Study your first profession

In the spring joint application process, the Turku Vocational Institute (TAI) offers numerous options in nearly 30 fields. In addition to the vocational qualification, you can study for a double degree or select a polytechnic or internationalisation path. Or is the apprenticeship or athlete path your thing? You can apply in the joint application process if you are graduating from basic education or you do not have a previous qualification in, for example, upper secondary school or vocational education and training.
