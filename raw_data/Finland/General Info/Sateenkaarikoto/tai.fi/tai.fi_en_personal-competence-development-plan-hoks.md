# Personal Competence Development Plan (HOKS)

Vocational qualifications consist of units of different scopes. Some of the studies are compulsory and some optional. In all qualifications, you can select different competence areas.

At the beginning of your studies, a personal competence development plan (HOKS) will be drawn up with you. We agreed on the completion of the degree and the acquisition of missing competence. You acquire competence by participating in studies offered by the educational institution and by learning in working life. You can also complete the qualification without training if you have the competence required in the qualification requirements.

Parts of vocational qualifications are completed by demonstrating your vocational skills in practical tasks, mainly at workplaces. In the demonstrations, we will assess how well you have achieved the vocational skills required for the degree. Your competence is assessed jointly by the teacher and a representative of working life.

A vocational upper secondary qualification, further vocational qualification and specialist vocational qualification provide general eligibility for higher education studies. Higher education institutions decide on more detailed admission criteria and they are published in the Studyinfo service.
