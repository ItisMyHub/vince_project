## Code of conduct of the Turku Vocational Institute 

The purpose of the code of conduct of the Turku Vocational Institute (TAI) is to guarantee each student and employee a safe environment to learn and work. The code of conduct promotes a safe learning environment to give everyone the opportunity to work comfortably in peace, which promotes the achievement of objectives related to learning and education. 

Every student at the Turku Vocational Institute has the right to equal treatment, personal freedom, bodily integrity and privacy. The Turku Vocational Institute promotes a culturally diverse atmosphere and intercultural understanding. If necessary, the Service Area Director can issue guidelines to supplement the code of conduct.

2.1. Everyone at the Turku Vocational Institute observes good manners, respects fellow students and staff, moves about calmly and uses appropriate language. 

Any kind of bullying or harassment based on origin, gender, religion, age, language, belief, opinion, state of health, disability or other personal characteristics is prohibited, and so is sexual harassment.

### 4. Use of mobile devices and social media

4.1. The distracting use of mobile devices in teaching situations is prohibited. 

Mobile devices may be used during class only with the teacher’s permission. Students mainly use devices provided by the school. So, as a rule, they do not need their own phones. Using social media during class is only allowed if it is part of the content of the lesson. Disseminating incorrect information and inappropriate messages about the educational institution or work placement facility and their personnel or fellow students is prohibited. There is an obligation of confidentiality for patient affairs during work placements, for other sensitive matters and for business secrets, also on social media.

4.2. In teaching situations, recording video and audio requires permission from the teacher, workplace instructor, customers and fellow students. Photos or videos taken during class may not be published on the internet, on social media or in another public place without the subject’s permission. Taking photos or videos in the changing rooms or toilet facilities is forbidden. 

4.3 Storage

During lessons, students should have their mobile devices turned on the “Do Not Disturb” mode (sounds off, vibrations off) and placed in their backpack, pocket or locked cabinet given to the student.

### 5. Property and supplies

The educational institution’s property must be handled carefully. If any property gets damaged or lost, it must be immediately reported to a teacher or another member of personnel. The liability for damage to property is determined in accordance with the Tort Liability Act (412/74). The educational institution is not responsible for any property left at the educational institution’s premises. The educational institution will not replace lost or stolen learning supplies, workwear, tools or other personal belongings.

Students must take good care of the items and workwear given or lent to them by the educational institution. Workwear may only be worn outside the school area when conducting matters related to teaching or work tasks.

### 6. Work safety and accidents

Students are obligated to comply with the guidelines on safety at work issued by the educational institution and teachers. 

If a student does not follow the safety guidelines, the teacher can remove the student from the facility. If a student does not have the equipment required by occupational safety and health, the teacher can remove the student from the classroom if necessary.

9.2. During the workday, teachers of the educational institution and the Head of Education have the right to inspect the items carried by students and, if necessary, confiscate dangerous items or substances if it is evident that a student possesses such objects and, despite request, refuses to hand them over or cannot reliably demonstrate that they possess no such items. These inspections comply with provisions of the Vocational Adult Education Act.  

9.3. The Head of Education or the teacher may order a student to leave if they disrupt teaching or behave violently or in a way that endangers the life and health of another person. The student may be ordered to leave the education provider’s event or a classroom or other space where instruction is provided for the remainder of a lesson. 

If a student refuses to leave despite being ordered to do so, the provisions laid down in the Vocational Adult Education Act apply.

If a student leaves the learning environment specified in the personal competence development plan without permission, the insurance cover for their studies does not apply.

Disciplinary measures are laid down in section 85 of the Vocational Adult Education Act
