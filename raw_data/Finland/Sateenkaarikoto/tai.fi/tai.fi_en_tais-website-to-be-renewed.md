The new website’s most important feature is the ability to search for study programs, as this will allow prospective applicants to browse the programs available at TAI. Visitors can use search filters when searching for specific study programs, such as those available in the joint application process.

The new website’s visual style is likely to see some changes during the first half of the year, and some pages still lack content. This applies in particular to the website’s language variants, i.e. the pages that have not yet been translated into Swedish and English. We aim to have these pages available by January–February.

We apologize for any inconvenience these changes may cause.
