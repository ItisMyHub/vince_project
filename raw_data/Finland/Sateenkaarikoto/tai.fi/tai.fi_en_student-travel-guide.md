### Travel documents (passport, identity card, visa)

As a Finnish citizen, you can use your passport as a travel document when travelling to all countries. Your passport is also your certificate of identity.

In EU countries, you can travel using your passport until its expiry date, i.e. your passport must be valid throughout your journey. If you are travelling outside the EU (e.g. China, India, Canada, Russia), check with the authorities of your destination country how long your passport must be valid after the end date of your trip (typically 3–6 months).

You can apply for a passport in Finland from a police department or electronically from the Police’s e-services.

PLEASE NOTE! If you intend to travel with a photo ID card, this is only possible in the Schengen Area (in Finnish).

If your destination country requires a visa, or you need a visa because of your nationality, you can apply for one from the embassy of your destination country. If you are traveling with an alien’s passport, remember to also keep your Finnish residence permit with you during your travels.

Scan or take photos of all your travel documents. Save your scanned/photo copies in a digital storage location. You can also share your copies with a friend or next of kin. Pack your original travel documents in your carry-on baggage.

### Travel notification and travel information

Finns travelling or moving abroad can submit a travel notification to provide their travel and contact information to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. This way, in the event of an emergency or crisis, the Ministry can contact those citizens who have registered their details. TAI recommends submitting a travel notification if you intend to go on an exchange that will last at least 3 weeks.

You can submit a travel notification:

The Ministry for Foreign Affairs also provides information on the security status of different countries. We recommend familiarising yourself with the travel information for your destination country before your departure (page available in Finnish and Swedish).

The COVID-19 pandemic or other emergency conditions may affect your ability to travel to and in different countries. Remember to make sure that you have the documents and certificates you will need for entry.

### Store your travel tickets and important contact information

We recommend making both electronic and paper copies of your travel tickets.

Use your phone to store the contact details of the teacher supervising the period, the international coordinator, and your contact person in the destination country, as well as the address of where you will be staying. Remember to also keep a paper copy of this information on hand, and leave one copy with your guardian as well. Most of the information is available in your Training Agreement.

### Insurance

TAI students are covered by travel insurance, and they are also insured against occupational accidents during both domestic and international training agreement periods. You can request your insurance certificate from the international coordinator.

Students can also elect to take out baggage insurance.

### Financial matters and phones

If you are going on an exchange through an educational institution, you will often receive a grant from your institution for your exchange period. In most cases, this grant will cover your accommodations and flights. You can also receive money for your meals, depending on the duration of your exchange. The finer details of your trip’s financing are specified in the financing agreement that you will go through with the international coordinator.

Arrange your financial matters with your bank before you leave. You must have a bank card (e.g. MasterCard, debit card, or Visa Electron) that you can use in your destination country. You can also bring some cash in the currency of your destination country. You should also find out whether your phone will work abroad and how much it will cost to use mobile data, for example.

### In-flight baggage

Check the permissible weight and dimensions of carry-on and checked bags on your airline’s website. Your airline is specified on your ticket. TAI will not reimburse you for any additional fees for overweight or oversized baggage.

Pack the following in your carry-on baggage:

Your checked bag should be durable and easily identifiable. Mark your bag with your contact information.

### European Health Insurance Card

If you are travelling to the EU/EEA or Switzerland, order a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) from Kela. With this card, you will receive essential medical care at the same price as the citizens of that country, when you are temporarily staying in an EU or EEA state or Switzerland. 

The card is free of charge and can be ordered from Kela either by calling +358 20 692 203 or via Kela’s website.

### Vaccinations or vaccination certificates

Contact TAI’s nurse and get your vaccinations in order after you have confirmed your country of destination.

You must purchase your vaccinations yourself, but you will be reimbursed for any compulsory vaccinations as part of your exchange grant. Submit the receipts for the vaccinations you have purchased to the international coordinator. Any voluntary vaccinations will not be reimbursed.

For more information on vaccinations, visit: www.rokote.fi (available in Finnish)

Obtain the necessary vaccinations and medication and vaccination certificates well in advance according to your vaccine instructions, but no later than 1 month before you leave. Bring the certificates of all compulsory vaccinations with you while abroad.

### Hygiene and personal medicines

Different countries across the world have different levels of hygiene.

Remember that your exchange is only temporary, and that it is an opportunity to immerse yourself in different cultures! However, different foods and climates can stress your skin and stomach, for example. If you have constant health concerns abroad, contact your supervising teacher and the international coordinator.

In particular, when it comes to food and beverage hygiene, remember the following:

We recommend bringing your own “personal pharmacy” on your trip. This includes:

### Air travel

Arrive at the airport in time! For international flights, you should arrive at the airport approximately two (2) hours before departure. Students must personally organise their journey to the airport.

Complete your check in on the airline’s website, at a self-service check-in machine, or at the airline’s counter. You will need your flight ticket reservation number and passport or ID card when checking in.

If you have any bags that you wish to check in, take them to the airline’s baggage drop counter.

### Security check

During the security check, your carry-on baggage will be screened and you will be asked to walk through a metal detector. In addition, airport staff often conduct random drug inspections by testing for traces of drugs on your hands and bags.

You will be asked to empty your pockets and place your outerwear and belt in a basket for screening. If you have any liquid containers (up to 100 ml per container) in a transparent pouch or any electronics with you, you will need to take them out of your bag before it is screened. Follow the instructions given to you.

### Follow the monitors at the airport

After the security check, check your departure gate from an airport monitor. You must be at the departure gate no later than 30 minutes before the departure time of your flight.

Follow the monitors at the airport to stay aware of any changes in your schedule or departure port. If your trip includes a layover, the monitors at the airport will show you which terminal and gate your next flight will depart from.

### Set your phone in airplane mode

Set your phone in airplane/flight mode for the duration of your flight. You may use the Wi-Fi connection on your tablet or laptop, but not during take-off and landing.

Your flight ticket will indicate whether your flight includes any free meals. You are also permitted to bring your own food as well as beverages bought from the airport.

### When you arrive

When you move from your plane to the terminal, check the nearest monitor to see where you can pick up your baggage. There may be more than one baggage claim area, with several conveyor belts in each area.

You will exit the baggage claim area through a customs check. If you have travelled outside the Schengen Area, your identity will most likely be checked again before you leave the transit area.

### Personal safety

Remember that your family and friends also miss you – so don’t forget to tell them how you’re doing every now and then!

Enjoy your experience – try new things, but keep your wits about you in all situations!
