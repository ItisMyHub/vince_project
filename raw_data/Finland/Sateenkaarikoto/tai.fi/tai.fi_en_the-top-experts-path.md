## Did you that at the Turku Vocational Institute, you can choose the Top Expert’s Path?

We are an educational institution for everyone – including those hoping to become top professionals. We want to distinguish ourselves as a top-level educational unit for professionals.

The Huippuosaajana toimiminen (Working as a Top Expert) unit (HUIPTO), 15 cp, is available to all students in vocational education and training regardless of their field. This professional and optional unit can be selected during your studies at a time when it suits you. It is geared towards motivated students who are looking to get more out of their studies and who enjoy challenges. They have made good progress in their studies with no unnecessary absences.

During the HUIPTO unit, you will team up with other top experts and study together through reciprocal team learning. Among other things, HUIPTO opens up opportunities to seek out international apprenticeships and professional networking in your own field, which will help you find employment. If you wish, you can participate in vocational skills competitions. At the same time, you can strengthen your professional pride, improve your social skills and ability to handle pressure and gain courage.

## Why does the Turku Vocational Institute want to offer this opportunity to all fields of study?

Our goal is to provide a tailored top-level path to students in vocational education and training. This is for the purposes of improving the image, visibility and attractiveness of vocational education and training. At the same time, we want to address working life needs and guarantee top-level employees for companies. We see this as an excellent way to also improve staff competences and innovation.
