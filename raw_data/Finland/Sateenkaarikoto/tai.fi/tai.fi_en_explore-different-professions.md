## Welcome to the study program of the Turku Vocational Institute (TAI)

At TAI, we offer two training programs and basic vocational qualifications in English:

We have an individualized learning path for every single student. The learning paths are based on the student’s skills, characteristics as well as earlier know-how and studies. 

After completing your basic vocational qualification, you can also apply to universities and colleges in Finland. 

## Studies and applying

Rolling admission is aimed especially at upper secondary school graduates and those who are changing career direction and already have some previous studies or work experience. Applicants with upper secondary or higher-level qualifications completed abroad are also suitable for the program if their Finnish language skills are not sufficient for Finnish-language vocational education (Ravintola- ja catering alan perustutkinto, Puhtaus- ja kiinteistöpalvelualan perustutkinto).  
The studies require both good English language skills and good study skills. 

All eligible applicants will be interviewed.
