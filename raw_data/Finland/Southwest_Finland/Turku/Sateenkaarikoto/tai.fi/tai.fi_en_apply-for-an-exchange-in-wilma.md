## Before applying

Before applying for an exchange, please speak with the teacher in charge. Speak with the teacher in charge about matters such as when would be the best time to go for an exchange and what part of your degree an exchange would best be suited for.

The Working in an International Working Environment module is a good option, as it is designed for work placement periods abroad.

You can apply for an exchange if:

An exchange is generally 1-2 month-long work placement period in a workplace abroad in the student’s own field. You can go to a country in which a TAI partner is located or search for a job independently, if you and the teacher in charge agree on this.  You can get a grant from Turku Vocational Institute to help cover your accommodation and travel costs, but you will also need some money of your own when on an exchange.

## Application for international student exchanges in the Wilma system in September and February

An application for an international student exchange must be submitted in Wilma in the section Applications and decisions (Hakemukset ja päätökset). The application period for spring exchanges is in September, while the application period for exchanges in the autumn term is open in February.

If you are planning to go for an exchange, speak with the teacher in charge about your plans before applying. Plan the timing of the exchange and the studies that are suited for the exchange and enter them in your Personal Competence Development Plan (HOKS). The teacher in charge must process and approve your exchange application in Wilma.

## Internationalisation coaching

All students who go abroad with TAI funding will take part in the coaching course. Participation in the coaching is mandatory. You will be given the coaching times and dates during your exchange interview. The coaching course and the online assignments included in the course must be completed successfully before departing on an exchange.
