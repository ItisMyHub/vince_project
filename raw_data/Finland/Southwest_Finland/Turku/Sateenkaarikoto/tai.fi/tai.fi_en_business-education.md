## Business education teaches you the ways of being an entrepreneur

Turku Vocational Institute focuses on business education. Students learn business skills at Innovation Camps, among others, which are attended by students from nearly all fields of study as part of their common modules. 

To support your personal business planning as well as the Business Planning and Business Operation modules, we will organise thematic coaching for business operations in the autumn and spring terms. Students who are planning business activities are encouraged to complete the optional module Business Planning.

During the academic year or holidays, students can, for example, flexibly run a 4H business and participate in events and marketplaces organised for young entrepreneurs.
