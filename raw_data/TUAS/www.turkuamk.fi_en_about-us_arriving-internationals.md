# Information for new international students

Are you an international talent moving to Finland for the first time? Here you can find some practical information to guide you as you start your journey with us.

### Start with these arrangements

Before you arrive, you need to take care of a few important things to prepare for your studies and life in Turku. From securing housing and gathering the necessary documents to making sure your study equipment meets the requirements, this section will teach you the essentials to ensure a smooth transition.

One of the first things you should do, is check whether you need a residence permit to study in Finland. 
Students arriving from non-EU/EEA countries need a residence permit to stay in Finland for more than three months.

We recommend that you start the application process for your residence permit immediately after you have received information of admission and paid the tuition fee, as the process can take several months.

- Before applying, read more on residence permit for studies on Finnish Immigration Service’s (Migri) website.
- You can also check out Migri’s Guide for students on how to apply for residence permit.
- Apply for a residence permit on Migri’s online service Enter Finland.
- Please note that you must visit a Finnish embassy or consulate in person as part of the application process. 
You cannot be granted a residence permit for studies, if your studies mainly consist of distance learning online and do not require you to stay in Finland. For shorter stays in Finland (e.g. in-person class days), you can apply for a tourist visa.

We recommend that you apply for the residence permit to be valid 2 weeks before the beginning of studies so you can arrive in Finland and settle before the studies begin.

D-visa. You can apply for a 100-day D visa at the same time as you apply for a residence permit. The D visa allows you to travel to Finland immediately after you have been issued with a residence permit and a D visa sticker has been attached to your passport. You should apply for a D visa only if you can travel to Finland within 2 weeks of being granted a residence permit, because you need to collect your residence permit card from a collection point in Finland. Read more on D visa on Finnish Immigration Service’s (Migri) website.

Staying in Finland less than 90 days? Read more on visas on the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland’s website.

If you are an EU citizen planning to stay in Finland for longer than three months, you must register your right of residence. This registration is necessary to stay in Finland legally and access local services. The process is straightforward and can be completed through the Finnish Immigration Service (Migri).

For detailed steps, eligibility, and required documents, please visit the official Migri EU registration page.

Nordic citizens do not need to apply for EU registration at the Finnish Immigration Service. If you are a Nordic citizen (citizen of Denmark, Iceland, Norway or Sweden), register your personal data at the Digital and Population Data Services Agency.

The biggest student housing provider in Turku is the Turku Student Village Foundation (TYS). There is a high demand for student housing, so be sure to apply early.

Degree students at universities of applied sciences and universities pay a health care fee to Kela. As a degree student at a higher education institution, you can use the services of the Finnish Student Health Service (FSHS).

Find out more about FSHS services

The student healthcare fee is part of the overall funding for healthcare for university students. You have to pay this fee even if you do not receive student financial aid or use occupational health services instead of the FSHS, for example.

Read more about the health contribution for university students

If you are covered by another EU or EEA country, Switzerland or Great Britain and Northern Ireland, you do not have to pay a health contribution. However, you can use the services of the YTHS. Find out what you need to do on the Kela website.

Payment of the healthcare fee

The health insurance fee must be paid for each semester. Kela does not send a separate invoice for the fee, but you must remember to pay it yourself.

The due date for the healthcare contribution depends on when you register as being present.

See Kela’s website for more detailed payment instructions and due dates.

## Living costs in Finland

Finland is known for its high standard of living, with costs comparable to other Nordic countries and Western Europe.

To help you better plan and prepare for life in Finland, we have compiled information on the different costs linked with living here. Please note that living costs vary from person to person, depending on factors such as housing prices and consumption choices.

Applicants who are not citizens of the EU, EEA or Switzerland are required to pay an application fee in order to apply to higher education studies in Finland. Read more on the application fee on Studyinfo’s webpage.

Turku UAS charges a tuition fee in the Bachelor’s and Master’s degree programmes offered in English from students who are not citizens of countries of the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland.

If you are coming from outside the EU/EEA, you will need a residence permit for studies to stay in Finland and complete your studies. The first residence permit costs is EUR 450, if you apply online. For more information on residence permit costs, please visit Migri’s website.

###### Sufficient funds

According to Migri, the Finnish Immigration Service, you must have sufficient funds for living in Finland during the entire period of validity of your residence permit. The income threshold required by the Finnish immigration services Migri is minimum EUR 800 / month meaning that the sum is EUR 9,600 per year per individual student. If you arrive with family, you must also take into account the income requirements for family members.

Please take into consideration that this sum is the minimum requirement, and it does not necessarily cover all expenses. We strongly advise our students to ensure they have sufficient funds and not to depend on finding part-time work in Finland, as the students’ primary responsibility is to progress in the studies.
For more information on income requirements, please visit Migri’s website.

###### Health insurance

To obtain a residence permit, you must have private insurance to cover your medical and drug expenses, unless you have a Kela card, a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC), or a UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC). Read more on health insurance on Migri’s website.

The rental prices vary depending on the size, location and the level of housing, and whether you rent from a private market and share with other tenants. The accommodation prices range often between EUR 350 and EUR 800 per person. If you share a flat with other tenants, you can save significantly.

The apartments in Finland are rarely furnished, so you have to buy furniture and household equipment, such as a bed, table and chairs, kitchen utensils, etc.

It is highly recommended, and sometimes required by landlords, to have home insurance to protect against potential damage to the tenant’s property and liability for damages caused to the apartment or nearby flats.

###### Computer

Remember that you are expected to have your own laptop. Read more on requirements for having your own laptop for your studies.

###### Transportation

Before coming to Finland, you must acquire your transportation tickets to Turku or Salo. Don’t forget to account for the train, bus, or taxi expenses from the airport.

In Turku, the local transportation company Föli’s single ticket costs around EUR 3,15–4,15 depending on the purchase method and the time of the day. A student’s monthly ticket card costs approx. EUR 40. Cycling, whether on your own bike or a rental bike, is also an affordable choice. There are also rental electric scooters easily available. Walking is also an option in Turku.

In Salo, the local transportation company Paikku offers single tickets for around EUR 3,45–4 depending on the purchase method, and a 30-day monthly ticket for approx. EUR 65. If you live in Turku and study in Salo, a train ticket to Salo costs between EUR 3,10–5,60.

###### Groceries

The sum that you need for groceries vary depending on your consumer habits but you can estimate the cost to be between EUR 200–400 a month per person.

Student-priced meals at student restaurants cost EUR 2,95 per meal. Read more on student lunch and the requirements.

Even if a student’s residence permit allows part-time working (max. 30 hours per week), the main aim for students is to proceed with their studies. It is therefore not possible for students to count on financing their living expenses solely by working. Finding a temporary job is demanding especially if the student does not have a working knowledge of the Finnish language. Therefore, it is essential to focus fully on your studies from the beginning and start learning Finnish alongside them.

If you are not already a trained professional, you can apply for entry-level positions. Common jobs for international students e.g. cleaning, working in a restaurant (waiter/waitress, kitchen helper), delivering newspapers/mail, or delivering food. Finding a job in Finland isn’t easy or guaranteed, even for assisting or low-paying positions.

The student salaries often range between EUR 7 to EUR 13 per hour. For entrepreneurs, there are no minimum earnings. You must take into consideration that you are required to pay tax, and the amount depends on your income. Bear in mind, though, that only part-time work is allowed.
