Equality means that men and women have the same opportunities, rights and obligations in all areas of life. Equality means that both men and women make decisions about their own bodies and their sexuality.

Equality means greater freedom for everyone. Everyone should have the potential to be themselves and to feel safe.

Equality is discussed in most countries and many countries are in the process of becoming more equal. However, no country has complete equality yet.

## Equality is for both men and women

Most often, it's girls who lose out when there is a lack of equality. Men have more power and money in the world. But boys lose out in other ways.

## There are political objectives for equality

In Sweden, parliament has said that equality is important. There are plans for how to make society equal. These plans deal with the following:

It is discriminating to be treated differently because you are a woman or a man. Discrimination is illegal.

## A few examples that show that society isn’t equal

These examples are supported by statistics. They apply to women as a group and men as a group. Of course, these are not true for everyone. And, naturally, there are differences among men, and there are differences among women.

## Why aren't things equal?

There are several explanations, which are interrelated. One of them is the way things have been throughout history, that men have had more power for a long time. This has affected laws, traditions and other things that take a long time to change. And people who are used to having a lot of power can be resistant to change because they want to keep the advantages they have.

Another explanation is that different things are seen as "masculine" or "feminine". For example, what you should like, what emotions you should show or what kind of job you should have. These become like invisible rules for how girls and boys should be. Sometimes it may feel OK for it to be this way. But sometimes it can be very troubling or wrong.

What is considered "masculine" and "feminine" can vary in different parts of the world. And it can change over time.

## What do you think?

Think about what this is like in your life. And consider how you think about men and women. Then it can be easier to do something yourself to make society more equal. For example, speak up when something is unjust.

### Film: Discrimination

Discrimination means that you are treated worse than others based on your gender, religion, age, sexual orientation or because of where you come from. It is also discrimination if you are treated worse than others because, for instance, you are in a wheelchair or are visually impaired, or because you feel that your gender doesn’t match your body. It is illegal to discriminate against anyone.

### Film: You decide over your body

Every person has the right to make decisions regarding their own body. This is a human right. But what does it mean?
