It’s common for there to be different opinions in a family. For example about what time you should come home at night, what clothes you wear or how you use social media. There’s no law that decides these things. Instead, you and your family have to come to an agreement.

## What you get to decide

You have the right to decide certain things for yourself, even if you’re under the age of 18. For instance:

## Right to go to school

All children in Sweden are required by law to attend school from Years 1 to 9. This means that you have to attend lessons, unless you’re ill. No-one is allowed to stop you going to school. No-one is allowed to stop you going to certain lessons. The same applies to school trips and work experience.

## You decide whether to have sex

You have the right to masturbate or have sex in some other way, if you want to. You decide over your own body. No-one in your family or anyone else can forbid this.

No-one is able to tell whether or not you’ve had sex. It doesn’t show on your vagina or penis, or in any other way. There is no membrane that covers the opening of the vagina.

You can get protection against pregnancy, if you want it.

You don’t need permission from your parents or guardians, the person you are having sex with or the person you are married to.

## You decide whether you want to get married

You should only get married if it’s because you want to, and if it’s with the person you want to get married to. You should both want to get married. You must be 18 years old to get married. It’s illegal to force someone to become engaged, or get married.

## What parents get to decide

Here are some examples of what your parents or guardians are allowed to decide for you, if you’re under the age of 18:

Adults can also decide on things like that you need to clean your room. They can tell you to help out at home. But they also have to give you time to study, do things in your free time and rest.

## Things that no-one can do to you

There are some things that no-one is allowed to do to you. Not your parents, guardians or any other family member for that matter.  For instance:

## Honour

In some families or extended families, it’s important that no-one brings dishonour to the family. There may be rules within the family or extended family, for example that a girl is not allowed to have sex before she is married. This means that she can’t have a boyfriend, or spend her free time with boys.

These rules tend to be strictest for girls, but there are also rules that apply to boys.

The family’s rules might mean that you aren’t allowed to meet up with friends after school, use social media, or wear the clothes that you want.

The rules might mean that you can’t study or work with what you want, or marry the person that you want to marry.

Various people might check up on you to make sure that you aren’t doing anything wrong. You could be punished if you break the family’s or extended family’s rules. This might include being beaten, threatened, called bad things or excluded from the family.

This is known as honour-related violence or oppression and it’s illegal. It is also a breach of your human rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Do you have to check up on your siblings? Some people are required to keep check on their sisters or other relatives, because the family or extended family is concerned that they might be getting a bad name for themselves.

But everyone has the right to live their own lives in whatever way they wish. This is the case regardless of what country you come from, your religion or culture.

You or others in your family or extended family may think you know what is best for someone, but that person might not agree with you. You have to respect that.

You have the right to live your own life and shouldn’t have to check up on others.

There are organisations that help young people who are suffering from honour-related oppression. They can offer all sorts of help. You can remain anonymous when you contact them. 
Here is a list of places where you can get help if you have questions about honour-related violence or oppression. In Swedish at UMO.se

## Tips on what you can do

- Tell the adults in your family how you feel, if you can 
Is it possible to talk to someone in your family about how you feel? Maybe one of your parents?
- Are you unable to talk to the adults around you? 
It´s still important you tell someone if you have problems at home. Tell an adult you trust, for example a friend´s parent, a sports coach, a teacher, the school counsellor or someone at a Youth Guidance Centre.
- Are you not allowed to join in with sports, school trips or something else at school? 
Tell a teacher or other adult at your school. That person may be able to talk to your parents or guardians about the importance of your being allowed to join in.
- Contact an organisation that helps young people who are having problems at home. They can help you with different things. You can contact them anonymously.
- Social services are required to help you if things are difficult at home 
They can sometimes arrange a safe place for you to live, for example if you’ve been threatened. You can find the number to call social services on your local municipality’s website.
- Call the police if you or someone you know is the victim of a crime, such as being beaten or threatened 
Call 112 if it’s an emergency. Call 114 14 if it’s not an emergency. Call +46 77 114 14 if you’re abroad.
## Sometimes adults are required to report what you tell them

Everyone who works in a school or at a health service must follow rules around confidentiality. This means that they are not allowed to talk about you, with anyone else. However, there are exceptions for people under the age of 18. Staff members are required to tell social services if they think that something bad is happening to you, such as someone being violent towards you. This is also a requirement for many other adults who work with young people. You can ask the adult you’re talking to, if you have any questions about this.

### Film: Secret love

Reza and Aliyah want to be together, but they’re worried that Reza’s family won’t accept their relationship.

### Film: You decide over your body

Every person has the right to make decisions regarding their own body. This is a human right. But what does it mean?

### Equality

Girls and boys shall have the same rights and opportunities. Society isn’t equal yet, but there are laws and plans about how to make it equal.

### Human rights

Human rights protect your right to live a good life. You have the right to education and health care. You have the right to be treated fairly and the right to flee to another country if you are in danger.
