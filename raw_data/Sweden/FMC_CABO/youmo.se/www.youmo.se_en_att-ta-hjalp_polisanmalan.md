It is a good idea to make a police report as soon as possible after a crime has taken place. You are however still allowed to report a crime even if a long time has past since the crime occurred.

## Why should I report a crime to the police?

It is a good idea to report a crime to the police for several reasons.

## What can I get help with?

As a victim of crime, you have the right to legal aid from a lawyer during the preliminary investigation and trial. You do not need to pay for this. Let the police or prosecutor know that you would like legal aid.

You can also get help if you are afraid of or have been threatened by the person who has committed a crime against you. This person can be given a restraining order, which will prohibit them from visiting, calling or contacting you in any way. You file for a restraining order with the police.

## What will the police want to know?

When making a police report you should always say your name, your phone number and where you live. You also have to tell the police as much as you can about what has happened. For instance where and when it happened.

The police will ask you different things depending on the crime. The police may want to know what kind of injuries you have if you have been abused. The police may want to know which brand and model your phone had, if your phone has been stolen.

You are allowed to change or add things to your police report after you have made an initial statement.

## How can I save evidence of the crime?  

The police may want to look at traces from the crime. Therefore you should not clean up or change things where the crime occurred. You shouldn´t clean or get rid of your clothes if you have been abused or sexually assaulted.

It is good if you get a medical examination if you have been abused or sexually assaulted. For instance, you can get a medical examination at a hospital´s emergency room, Heath Centre or a Youth  Guidance Centre.    

There is evidence that you can collect yourself. For instance you can make screenprints on your mobile phone or computer if someone is threatening you or has shared photos of you.

## Who gets to know that I have made a police report?

The police doesn´t tell just anyone about your police report. But a police report cannot be completely secret. The police may need to tell a prosecutor, social services or your parents or legal guardians – but only if it is safe for you. The police may also tell persons suspected of the crime. Let the police know if you are afraid of the person you have reported. The police needs to know if you are in need of protection.
