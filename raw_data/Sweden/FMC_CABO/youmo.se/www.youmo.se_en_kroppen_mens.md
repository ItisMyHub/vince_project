## When will I get my first period?

The age when your first period comes differs from person to person. Most people get their first period sometime between the ages of 11 and 14. You could start getting your period when you are 9 or 16 without anything being wrong. Contact the school nurse, a youth guidance centre or a healthcare centre if you haven't started your period by the time you are 16 years of age.

The colour of the period tends to be red for the first few days and brown for the last few days.
