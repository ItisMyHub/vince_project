## Question

I’m afraid that I won’t bleed when I have sex with my husband for the first time. My family or someone my family knows might check for blood. I don’t know what to do. My friend told me that I can have an operation to get my virginity back, how do I do that?

## Answer

You are not alone. Your question is quite common. For the answer to your question to make sense, you need to know a few things about the vagina.

### Facts about the vagina and how it works

The vagina has an opening that is present from birth. This means that there is no membrane covering or blocking the opening of the vagina. The tissue that is sometimes called a “hymen” is a myth – it doesn’t exist.

The vaginal opening looks different for everyone. It doesn’t change from having sex. No one can tell if you’ve had sex by looking at your body. Not even a doctor or midwife (a nurse specially trained in the female reproductive system).

The vagina is elastic. That’s why most people don’t bleed the first time they have sex. If you bleed, it may be because you are nervous or not aroused enough. You can also bleed even if you have had sex before.

### What is hymenoplasty?

Hymenoplasty (hymen repair) means an operation where a doctor sews a few stitches at the edge of the vaginal opening so that it will bleed during sex. But you need to know the following:

### What can you do?

I don’t think you should have an operation. I think you should talk to someone who can help you. Here are some examples of people you can talk to:

### Slide show: Nothing covers the entrance of the vagina

There is no way to tell that you’ve had sex or used a tampon just by looking at or touching your vagina. Most girls don’t bleed the first time they have sex because there is nothing covering the entrance of the vagina.

### Film: You decide over your body

Every person has the right to make decisions regarding their own body. This is a human right. But what does it mean?

### The vulva and vagina

Here you can read about the different parts of the vulva and vagina, and learn more about how your vulva and vagina work. The vulva and vagina are great parts of your body that can urinate, have periods, have sex, give birth to children and give enjoyment.

### Honour

In some families or extended families, it’s important that no-one brings dishonour to the family. There may be rules within the family or extended family, for example that a girl is not allowed to have sex before she is married. This means that she can’t have a boyfriend, or spend her free time with boys. This is known as honour-related violence or oppression and it’s illegal. It is also a breach of your human rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
