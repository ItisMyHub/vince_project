## Question

I’ve been in Sweden for one year and I don’t know very many people. How can I make new friends?

## Answer

Making new friends is important when you come to a new country. Many people find that this isn’t so easy. A good idea is to say hello and talk to other people when you are somewhere where you want to get to know people.

Have you started attending school? You will have opportunities to make new friends at school. If you find it difficult to get to know people at school, you can talk to an adult there, such as a teacher or a counsellor. Ask them if they can arrange activities at school or with other schools so that you and others get a chance to meet.

There is usually a youth recreation centre close to schools. This is for adolescents between the ages of around 13–18 years. Visit the centre, talk to the youth recreation leaders and take part in their activities if there is something that appeals to you.

There will undoubtedly be some clubs and associations in the town where you live, for instance, a sports club. Visit the club and see if you can join. Doing things together with others is usually fun and is a good way to make new friends. The counsellor at your school can help you find associations and clubs that interest you.

Some municipalities and cities have places where you can go and meet people, for instance, language cafes and organisations that arrange meetings and activities. Search online to see what is available where you live.
