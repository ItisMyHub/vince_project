### Films: Youth Guidance Centre

Maryam is in a lot of pain when she has her period. Alex doesn’t really feel like a girl, but instead feels more like a guy. Emil's never talked to anyone about how bad he feels. Simon's worried that he won’t get an erection when it’s time to have sex. Amanda’s worried that she might be pregnant. Aliyah and Reza are worried that Reza’s family won’t accept their relationship.

### Honour

In some families or extended families, it’s important that no-one brings dishonour to the family. There may be rules within the family or extended family, for example that a girl is not allowed to have sex before she is married. This means that she can’t have a boyfriend, or spend her free time with boys. This is known as honour-related violence or oppression and it’s illegal. It is also a breach of your human rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
