## Welcome to Turku Vocational Institute!

You are starting your studies at Turku Vocational Institute (TAI). We want to make sure you are off to a good start. In the following, please find some important information before your studies begin.

Read more about the degree you have selected in advance in the TAI Opinnot service. There, you will see what is included in your studies and what skills you will learn. You can also find information on different study paths and options in the service.

### Structure of studies

Degree programmes consist of vocational studies and, in vocational upper secondary qualification, also common degree components (YTO subject studies). Learning will take place both at the educational institution and at workplaces. You proceed in your studies according to an individual plan. Your teacher-in-charge will plan your studies with you.

### Support and guidance during studies

There are many ways to get support:

### At the beginning of studies

You will be informed of the tools and materials you will need for your studies when your studies begin – you do not need to acquire anything in advance.

It is recommended that you have a computer or mobile device at your disposal. Persons of compulsory education age will be provided with a computer for their personal use for the duration of their studies.

Tutor students help you get familiar with the school, tell you about school practices and help you get to know other students.

For more information on student rights, obligations, assessment and study support, see the TAI student’s guide.

### TAI units in different parts of Turku

Before starting your studies, check where your unit is located and how to get there. You will find the contact details and additional information on the TAI website.

If you have any questions, please contact a student advisor or the Student Affairs Office.

See you soon with your studies!
