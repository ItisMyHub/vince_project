## Options for different needs

The continuous application process offers basic qualifications for adults and young people, people changing fields, and the unemployed. The continuous application process also offers further and specialist vocational qualifications for those who already have previous competence. You can also use the continuous application process to apply directly for a qualification if you have already acquired the necessary competence. If you are an immigrant, the continuous application process offers basic education for adults, and preparatory education for an upper secondary qualification (TUVA) for young people and adults. These educational programmes begin at different times of the year.
