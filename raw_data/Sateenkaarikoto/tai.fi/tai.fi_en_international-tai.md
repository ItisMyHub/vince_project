## Welcome to Turku Vocational Institute

Turku Vocational Institute is one of the largest vocational schools in Finland, located in South-Western Finland in the city of Turku. We offer upper secondary vocational education and training and are classified at Level 4 on the European Qualifications Framework (EQF).

Each year, we educate over 10,000 students with the support of over 600 dedicated professionals. We provide vocational education for both young people in compulsory education and adult learners across a wide range of fields, including technology, business, health, and services. Our teaching is delivered on six campuses throughout Turku.

As a public educational institution, our mission is to provide practical, industry-relevant education that supports the needs of the labor market and society. Our highly qualified teachers and experts are committed to delivering high-quality education and project-based learning.

We are actively involved in international cooperation. Each year, many of our students complete part of their practical training abroad through programs funded by our school, Erasmus+, or other sources. We also welcome students from our partner institutions. Erasmus+ funding also enables us to support staff exchanges and organize group mobilities abroad.

In addition, we are actively engaged in vocational skills competitions both nationally and internationally. Our students regularly participate in competitions such as Taitaja (Finnish National Skills Competition), EuroSkills, and WorldSkills, where they have the opportunity to demonstrate their expertise, gain experience, and develop their professional confidence.

### International Activities

You can complete some of your studies abroad at a workplace or at one of TAI’s partner schools. Alternatively, you can improve your language skills and cultural competence by tutoring an international student in Finland. Or perhaps you are interested in participating in competitions that shape people into world-class top experts.
