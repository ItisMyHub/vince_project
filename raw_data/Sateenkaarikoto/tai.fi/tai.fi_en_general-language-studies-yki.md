# General Language Studies (YKI)

National Certificate of Language Proficiency tests are language proficiency examinations for adults. The tests measure language competence in practical situations where an adult has to speak, listen, write or read a foreign language – either in Finland or abroad. At the Turku Vocational Institute, the test can be taken in the following languages: Finnish, English and Swedish (basic, middle and highest levels).

Anyone can take part in National Certificate of Language Proficiency tests. Finnish language tests are intended for immigrants or foreigners. A certificate of an intermediate level test in Finnish is required for a citizenship application. Some institutions may also request a certificate.

As the test assignments and instructions are usually in Finnish or Swedish, completing the qualification requires Finnish or Swedish skills. The tasks and instructions of the intermediate and top level degrees in English are in English and the language of the tests is English.

## Demonstration of language proficiency when applying for Finnish citizenship

A precondition for obtaining Finnish citizenship is at least satisfactory oral and written Finnish or Swedish skills. Provisions on the language skills required for granting Finnish citizenship are laid down in the Citizenship Act (359/2003). More information on the requirements can be found on the website of the Finnish Immigration Service.
