## Pathway to universities of applied sciences in social and health care

In the Vocational Qualification in Social Services and Health Care, Pharmaceuticals and Equipment Maintenance, you can already complete studies at universities of applied sciences as part of your current studies. You will have the opportunity to familiarise yourself with studies at a university of applied sciences and to complete some of the degrees at a university of applied sciences. At the same time, you will increase the competence points of your current degree and improve your study skills with regard to possible further studies.

The studies are implemented as both online and face-to-face teaching (some also in the facilities of the University of Applied Sciences). If you continue your studies at Turku University of Applied Sciences after graduating from the Turku Vocational Institute, your studies at the University of Applied Sciences can be accepted as part of the new degree. At the same time, you can complete your practical nurse studies.

For more information on completing studies, please contact: Marja-Liisa Gustafsson and Elina Koskinen
