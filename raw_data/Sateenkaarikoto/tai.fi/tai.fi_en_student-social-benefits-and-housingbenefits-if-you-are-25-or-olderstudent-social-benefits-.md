## Student social benefits

Student social benefits are mainly granted for full-time studies. In some cases, benefits may also be granted for part-time studies. The amount of the benefit in euros is affected by your personal situation, your age, your income or other benefits you receive. Studying with unemployment benefit also requires that you are an unemployed jobseeker or a jobseeker at risk of unemployment in employment services. If the conditions for your benefit are not met during your studies, your benefit may be reduced, denied or recovered. As a student, it is your responsibility to ensure that the conditions are also met during the studies.
