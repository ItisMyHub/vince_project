# Learning Environments

Finnish vocational education is strongly competence based. Students can acquire competence in different manners; in practical and theoretical classrooms, companies or our physical and virtual learning environments.

Our physical learning environments allow vocational students to train with authentic tasks and customers while safely supported by close educational guidance. These facilities provide realistic working experiences to our students prior to and in between testing their skills in companies as well as valuable services to the community and the region. Online studies allow the students to follow individualized study paths at their own speed.

## Wisio entrepreneurship learning center

The multi-functional Wisio entrepreneurship learning center gathers many TAI student entrepreneurship practices and entrepreneurial support functions under one roof.

Wisio features the following student-operated services for outside customers:

• Wisio Wellness Center: hairdressing and cosmetology services by beauty and haircare students

• Café Wisio: café and a sales point for our restaurant and food industry students’ products

• Puuhaparkki: child care services and themed birthday parties by practical nursing students (for children over 1 years of age, up to 3 hours at a time)

Wisio also features facilities for entrepreneurship training and conferencing. We organize idea and training camps for our students to encourage their entrepreneurial mindset and teach them the basics of starting and running a business.

## The Oppimo learning and tutoring centers
