## Partnership Agreement

Welcome to cooperate with us, working life representative! A partnership agreement is an agreement between TAI and a company/other organisation that agrees on forms of cooperation that benefit both the company and TAI. Together, we can ensure that our students grow exactly the future employees you need at your workplace.

Our partnership agreement strengthens our cooperation and offers opportunities for annual planning, tailored workplace instructor training and innovative pedagogical experiments.

Join us and make us part of your everyday life… …together we build the future. Contact us:

## Mentor class – a bridge to future experts

Are you looking for an inspiring way to strengthen your company’s connection with TAI while developing the skills of future experts? Mentor class activities offer companies the opportunity to participate in cooperation with educational institutions

The mentor class is a group of pupils selected for cooperation with your company, with whom you are working in joint projects. Mentor class activities may also be a physical classroom with the name of your company. The aim is to support the students’ learning, provide them with practical views of working life and give your company an opportunity to get to know young experts and future employees.

## Professional Advisory Boards

The Professional Advisory Board is a body consisting of representatives of working life and the educational institution. Its task is to monitor the development of working life and education. The advisory board will make proposals to the education provider to develop the qualification requirements and the offer of education to better meet the needs of working life.

The aim of the cooperation is to improve the quality and attractiveness of vocational education and training. Cooperation between education and working life plays a key role in the development of vocational education and training.

Contact the secretary if you have any questions (e-mail details) or TAI’s joint e-mail.
