## For Workplace Instructors

Learning on the job is a key part of vocational education and training. During working life periods, students get to carry out real work assignments and develop their professional skills. These periods are part of the degree programmes and can be arranged under either a training agreement or an apprenticeship. The workplace instructor, the teacher and the entire work community collaborate to ensure that the working life period is successful.

The workplace instructor’s role is to support students in reaching their knowledge targets and in their professional development. The instructor will provide guidance and feedback throughout the period and often also evaluate the student’s demonstration of competence. The workplace instructor will partner with a vocational teacher who plans and monitors the progress of the working life period and is responsible for evaluations. The most crucial elements of learning on the job are clear targets for learning, guidance and evaluation. These factors will ensure that the student benefits as much as possible from their working life period and develops professionally.

## MobilTAI

Mobiltai is a tool developed jointly by the Turku Vocational Institute and Rediteq, which has been designed to support learning on the job. It enables the documentation, monitoring, guidance and evaluation of the learning process. With MobilTAI; teacher, students and workplace instructors can easily stay in contact and share messages, recordings, images and videos. MobilTAI runs on all devices, such as smartphones, tablets and computers, which makes it flexible and easy to use anywhere and at any time. It can be used either in a browser or through an application.

## Tiitus

The Turku Vocational Institute uses Tiitus to manage Varha jobs.

## Professional feedback

Professional feedback is an essential part of developing vocational education. It provides valuable insights into how our training meets the needs and expectations of working life. Professional feedback allows us to improve the quality of our training programmes and to ensure that the knowledge shared with our students is both current and relevant.

We regularly collect feedback from our partnering businesses and workplace instructors. The feedback helps us in developing degree criteria, learning environments and practical training to better meet the demands of working life. Feedback is collected anonymously: the names and workplaces of respondents are not shown in the feedback.

Workplaces that have employed students either under an apprenticeship or a training agreement will be asked to participate in a national professional feedback survey. It consists of two separate surveys, and responding will take approximately 5 minutes.

- The student’s workplace instructor should respond to the workplace instructor survey. The Finnish National Agency for Education will automatically email the workplace instructor survey to the instructor’s email address and/or phone after the student’s working life period has ended.
- The workplace survey will be filled out by a representative of the workplace that concluded the apprenticeship or training agreement. TAI sends the workplace survey to employers twice per year – in February and August. 
## Utilising survey results

The Turku Vocational Institute uses the survey results to improve collaboration between workplaces and the Institute. The survey results are used nationally to improve vocational education and training, for quality assurance and as a basis for the allocation of funding.
