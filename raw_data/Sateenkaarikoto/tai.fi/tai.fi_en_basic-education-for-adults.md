# Basic Education for Adults

Basic education for adults is suitable for you if you are over 17 years old and do not have a basic education certificate. Basic education provides you with knowledge and skills you need in upper secondary education or preparatory education for it. 

## Literacy phase

During the literacy phase, you will learn mechanical reading and writing in the Latin alphabet and the basics of Finnish. The literacy phase lasts a maximum of 1.5 years.

## Initial phase

In initial education, you will learn Finnish and other skills that you need to complete basic education or further studies. The education will help you integrate into Finnish society. It takes 1.5 years to complete the entire initial phase.

## Final stage

At the final stage, you will receive a basic education certificate. At the final stage, you will study the contents of the following subjects in accordance with the syllabus in basic education: S2, mathematics, English, social studies, history, biology, geography, chemistry, physics, health education, religion/ethics, guidance counselling and working life skills. The final phase will last 1.5 years.

## Implementation

Basic education for adults consists of three stages. The initial stage is determined by the student’s Finnish language proficiency level and their previous educational background.

The literacy and initial phase groups start several times a year. The final stage studies begin once a year. The starting and application dates are indicated on the education search website.

Studying is contact teaching. Teaching takes place Mon–Fri between 8 a.m. and 4:15 p.m. The duration of the studies is determined by a personal study plan.

## Price and support

Teaching and teaching materials are free of charge. During the school day, you will receive a free meal. You pay for your school trips.

The studies are full-time, so you can receive support from the Social Insurance Institution of Finland for your studies. Discuss the matter with your own employment service expert before starting your studies.
