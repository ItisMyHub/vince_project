## Do you have a can-do attitude and an ability to get inspired, and are you entrepreneurial?

Do you have ideas that you would like to try out already during your studies? Would you like to earn some money during your studies? Perhaps your dream could be to start a business of your own.

The Entrepreneurship Path does not require you to have a concrete business idea or ready-made concepts – what you need is a willingness to try. It is a way to boost your career and entrepreneurial skills. During your studies, you will be able to work on transforming your ideas and skills into products. Entrepreneurship studies will give you practical experience in being an entrepreneur while also allowing you to assess your own entrepreneurial capabilities. Entrepreneurial studies emphasise practice. For example, studying can take the form of joint projects between students of different fields.

The Entrepreneurship Path will allow you to  you can try entrepreneurship in practice at various TAI events, in TAT’s summer entrepreneur campaign or as a 4-H entrepreneur.
