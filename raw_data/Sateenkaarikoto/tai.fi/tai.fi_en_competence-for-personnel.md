## Apprenticeship

Apprenticeship as a solution to personnel training

With an apprenticeship, you train a skilled workforce for the needs of your company or community. An apprenticeship can be awarded to an employee already in an employment relationship or a new employee to be recruited. ​

In apprenticeship training, most of the studies and learning take place at the workplace. The choices of units and the duration of the training are planned taking into account the needs of the student and the employer.

As an entrepreneur, you can complete apprenticeship training in your own company. You must be a full-time entrepreneur and pay a YEL fee. In your own company, you can complete a vocational upper secondary qualification, a further vocational qualification or a specialist vocational qualification.
