## Raising your grades

You can improve the grading of your vocational upper secondary qualifications after your studies. You can raise your grade in assessed vocational units and common degree units. Raising a single grade costs EUR 150. Visit this page for more information on the structure and completion of vocational qualifications.

Fill in the Grade Raise form by selecting the button below. The responsible teacher will then contact you and arrange for an opportunity to raise your grade. You will also receive an invoice (EUR 150/grade) that must be paid before you attempt to raise your grade.

If you are currently a TAI student, you can discuss improving your grade with your teacher. In this case, you do not need to fill in the Grade Raise form.
