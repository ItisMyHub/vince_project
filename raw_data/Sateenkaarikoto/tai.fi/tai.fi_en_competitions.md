Taitaja is the largest annual championship in vocational education and training in Finland, with around 45 different participating professional fields. The competition is open to vocational education and training students aged 21 or younger. Some events have no age limit.

The competition includes TaitajaPLUS events for students who need special support, as well as events for international competitors and students from upper secondary schools and universities of applied sciences.

The finalists are determined through a semi-final round in January, with thousands of participating students from all over Finland. The winners of the semi-finals will advance to the finals in May, where around 400 students will compete for the Finnish championship in their respective fields.

Each year, hundreds of companies participate in e.g. the championship’s planning and judging. The Taitaja championship has helped forge strong bonds between businesses and educational institutions, and TAI has played a key role in these efforts. The national Taitaja championship was previously organised in Turku in 2005 and 2015.

The next Taitaja championship will be held in Turku, 5–8 May 2025.

Taitaja9 is a playful, active, and fun manual skills competition for Finnish 9th graders, where the focus is on everyday manual tasks and skills.

The purpose of the competition is to rouse the interest of comprehensive school pupils in vocational fields by engaging them in the manual skills required by different occupations. The competition aims to raise awareness of fields that require great manual skills, such as technology and textile and domestic work. It also aims to increase the attractiveness of vocational education and training and to enhance local cooperation between comprehensive schools, vocational institutions, and businesses.

Taitaja9 teams are composed of mixed three-person teams.  Speed and accuracy are the keys to success: competitors may be tasked to build a birdhouse, change a tyre, determine the centre of gravity, or sew a button. What unites all these tasks is that they are done manually, and doing them requires nimble fingers and a little ingenuity.

The annual finals are held in connection with the Taitaja competition. To reach the finals, the competitors must first advance through local and regional competitions. TAI is a leading organiser of these local competitions. Every year, approximately 100 teams from the region’s comprehensive schools compete for a chance to reach the regional competitions. The national finals have been hosted twice in Turku, in 2005 and 2015.

The next regional competition will be held at Raisio Regional Education and Training Consortium (Raseko) on 28 January 2025, and the finals in Turku on 5–8 May 2025.

Cultural competitions provide you with performance experiences and a chance to showcase your talent in different cultural fields, such as music, art, writing, or performing.
