## Internship under a training agreement

Secure your company’s future competence and offer students a place to learn in working life. The training agreement is a significant part of the student’s acquisition of competence and development into a professional or already as a professional in his or her field.

During the training agreement, the student is not in an employment relationship and is not paid a salary or other compensation. The employer also does not receive training compensation.

We plan the training agreement together with the student, the employer’s representative and the teacher of the field in question to ensure that the tasks are both compliant with the qualification and serve the employer.

The teacher acts as a contact person and supports both the workplace instructor and the student during the period.
